<h3>V0.1 Product</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v01-product"></div>
<p>
  This is the sample project morphed to be more like your target product. Functionality can be limited to only those
  that can be refactored from the sample project. e.g. support for adding and deleting floating tasks.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging" target="_blank">git tag</a> as <code>V0.1</code>.
  Refer to the Schedule page for further submission instructions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>:
  To consider this milestone as reached, you should have at least add/delete/find support for floating tasks.
  You should be able to do that by deleting/renaming the given Address Book code, without having to add too much new code.<br>
  The most important thing is not to break the code while morphing sample code to your target product.<br>
</p>

<h3>V0.1 Documentation</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v01-documentation"></div>
Update the following pages:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>About Us page</strong>:<br>
    This page is used for module admin purposes.
    <span class="highlighted">Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties</span>.
    For example, use a recent solo photo with your face clearly visible (similar to those in the 'Teaching Team'
    page).<br>
    The <span class="highlighted">photo of a team member should be <code>doc/images/githbubid.png</code></span>
    e.g. <code>doc/images/damithc.png</code> where <code>githubid</code> is the team member's
    GitHub ID <strong>in lower case</strong>. Remove photos of the SE-EDU developers. No need to include a photo
    of the supervisor.<br><br>
    Indicate the different roles played and responsibilities held by each team member. You can
    reassign these roles and responsibilities later in the project, if necessary.<br><br>

    <div class="bg-additional">
      <strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong><br>
      Roles imply aspects you are in charge of and responsible for.
      E.g., if you are in charge of documentation, you are the person who should allocate who should write which part,
      ensure the document is in right format, ensure consistency etc. <br>
      Here are some typical roles:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Team lead</em>: Responsible for overall project coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Documentation</em>em> (short for ‘in charge of documentation’): Responsible for the quality of various
          project
          documents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Testing</em>: Ensures the testing of the project is done properly and on time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Code quality</em>: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards,
          etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Deliverables and deadlines</em>: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Integration</em>: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository,
          integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Scheduling and tracking</em>: In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>[Tool ABC] expert</em>: e.g. Eclipse expert, Git expert, etc. Helps other team member with matters
          related to
          the specific tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>In charge of[Component XYZ]</em>: e.g. In charge of Model, GUI, Storage, etc.
          If you are in charge of a component, you are expected to know that component well, do the initial refactoring
          of the component (during V0.1 and V0.2) and review changes done to that component in V0.3-V0.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may define additional roles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Please make sure each of the above roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a
      ‘backup’ for
      each role, but you should still have one person who is unequivocally the main person playing that role.
    </div><br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>README.md</strong> page: Update it to match your project. In particular, add a UI mockup of
    your intended final product. <br>
    Note that the <span class="highlighted">image of the UI should be <code>doc/images/Ui.png</code></span>
    so that it can be downloaded by our scripts.<br>
    Also, remember to acknowledge the original source of the code
    i.e. The sample project created by SE-EDU initiative at <code>https://github.com/se-edu/</code></li>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>:
  To consider this milestone as reached, you should have all V0.0 deliverables completed and the two documents
  mentioned above updated.<br>
