                  Overview: During the detailed design, which can be complex,
                  it is good to follow a common design paradigm. OO is the paradigm followed most widely in the industry.
                  When using OO, we view a system as interacting objects. Objects represent entities in the real world and
                  encapsulate data and operations related to those entities.
