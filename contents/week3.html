                After you have at least a tentative team, it is time to start thinking about product design.

                Tutorial 1 exercise gave you a 'Yes' pile of user stories. Use that as a baseline 
                for your product design. Note that what you have is just a collection of user stories 
                which may not necessarily translate into a good product. You might have to do more 
                reshuffling of user stories before they form a cohesive product that appeals to the 
                target users. More about product design will be covered in a future lecture.
