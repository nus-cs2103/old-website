	This is a working system containing the functionality you have selected to deliver at this milestone.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span class="highlighted">It should be a viable, possibly minimal product</span>.
		This is not a walking skeleton. A user should be able to use
		it. It may not be user-friendly, but is should not be unusable. Try to include at least the basic CRUD
		facilities for at least one type of tasks. Here are some examples that are NOT acceptable:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not support commands for deleting or
			editing tasks: This is not usable because the user cannot rectify errors made while creating tasks.
		</li>
		<li>
			example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not connected to the UI: This too is not
			usable by the end-user.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		This is <span class="highlighted">an internal release, not a production release.</span> 
		While you are expected to maintain a reasonable code
		quality at all times, we do not require V0.1 to be ‘polished’ in UI, design, code, or testing. It is more of a
		‘proof of concept’ prototype. The design is not required to be pure OO. Make a reasonable attempt to make it
		OO. Further refinement to the design can be done in V0.2 onwards.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="highlighted">Use V0.1 to validate your architecture.</span> This means you should 
		try to include all major components of your
		architecture in V0.1, even if they are not fully implemented.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="highlighted">Use V0.1 to try out ‘high risk, high value’ features.</span> 
		In particular, the feature that is expected to make
		your product ‘stand out’ from the rest should be tried out as early as possible.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>submission</strong>: Not required. Just do a demo during the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>deadline</strong>: *Before* your tutorial slot. No last-minute hacking during the tutorial.

<p>
	<strong>evaluation</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
	The most important thing is to have a working version of the system.<br>
	15 points (if you have passed the minimal level of progress expected at this time). Less than 15 if you need
	some catching up to do, depending on how far behind you are.
