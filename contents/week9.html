              setup instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.<br>
              e.g. <code> Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
              <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></li>
            <li>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</li>
            <li>Assign the above issues to suitable milestones (in GitHub).</li>
            <li>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than
              the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.
            However, if you do not have a working product at the milestone deadline, or the milestone plan doesn't
            match the project at the milestone, we'll consider that as <span class="highlighted">a 'missed milestone'
            which will count against the 'project management' component of your final grade</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use Github Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels to track your project schedule.
            You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU" target="_blank">
            Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.

          <p>
            IMPORTANT: To consider the milestone as 'reached', <span class="highlighted">you should have the

          Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for V0.2 but compulsory from V0.3.

              <strong>Step 1. Reach a team consensus on patterns and principles</strong><br>
              Display the project manual on the TV screen and use it to explain to the other team members 
              how patterns and principles covered in Lecture 8 relate to the project. We expect you to cover 
              around n patterns and n principles in total (n = team size). In case multiple members cover the 
              same pattern/principle, look for more to fill the shortfall (i.e. what other pattern/principle can 
              we relate to the project?). <br>
              You must explain: <br>
              1. the pattern/principle in general i.e. the problem it solves, how it solves the 
              problem.<br>
              2. How the pattern/principle is applied (or not applicable) to the project.<br>
              <br>
              Help each other to correct misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2. Explain to the tutor how you relate patterns and principles to the project</strong><br>
              Explain to the tutor the consensus you reached in step 1. Use the developer guide as a visual aid, 
              as you did in step 1.<br>
              The tutor will give feedback on whether your understanding and the application of the pattern/principle
              is correct. But do not expect the tutor to "teach" you the pattern. If your understanding was found to
              be incorrect, you need to go back to the handouts (or use any other resource) to correct your understanding
              and try to explain it again to the tutor.

            Singleton is a neat pattern and it is easy to explain too. That is why it is used often to
            illustrate  the concept of design patterns. However, there is a concern that Singletons are evil,
            especially when used excessively.
