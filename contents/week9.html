                 Until now, stronger coders in the team may have written code in all components of the 
                 product, to get the product up and running. It is fine for strong programmers take such initiative 
                 in getting the product off the ground. However, as the product gets more stable, try to limit your 
                 work to your own components only. When you need changes in a component handled by 
                 another team member, ask that member to do the change. While this may slow down your 
                 progress a bit, it is an essential part of working in a team. Editing others' code freely might affect 
                 your team's morale too.

          <div>
            Identify patterns and principles (at least one principle and one pattern) related to your part of 
            the project. You should be able to explain the identified patterns and principles using diagrams 
            in the project manual V0.1. This is also a good test of whether your project manual V0.1 has 
            enough diagrams. If it doesn't, make a note to add more diagrams for the next project manual 
            submission.
            Optionally, you may discuss your findings with your team and refine further before coming to 
            the tutorial. It is OK if you haven't actually applied these patterns/principles to the project yet. 
            You can still describe how you could have applied them or even why you would not apply them 
            for a particular scenario.

              <strong>Step 1. Reach a team consensus on patterns and principles</strong><br>
              Display the project manual on the TV screen and use it to explain to the other team members 
              how patterns and principles covered in Lecture 8 relate to the project. We expect you to cover 
              around n patterns and n principles in total (n = team size). In case multiple members cover the 
              same pattern/principle, look for more to fill the shortfall (i.e. what other pattern/principle can 
              we relate to the project?). <br>
              You must explain: <br>
              1. the pattern/principle in general i.e. the problem it solves, how it solves the 
              problem.<br>
              2. How the pattern/principle is applied (or not applicable) to the project.<br>
              <br>
              Help each other to correct misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2. Explain to the tutor how you relate patterns and principles to the project</strong><br>
              Explain to the tutor the consensus you reached in step 1. Use the developer guide as a visual aid, 
              as you did in step 1.<br>
              The tutor will give feedback on whether your understanding and the application of the pattern/principle
              is correct. But do not expect the tutor to "teach" you the pattern. If your understanding was found to
              be incorrect, you need to go back to the handouts (or use any other resource) to correct your understanding
              and try to explain it again to the tutor.
