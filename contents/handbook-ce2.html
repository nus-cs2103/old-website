	Here are the things to do for CE2 (read all instructions before you start CE2).
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		After CE1 code written by your classmates are made available on IVLE, do look for code that reads better than
		yours. Think about what makes them more readable than yours. If you did not attend lecture 2, please watch
		the webcast to learn what we consider ‘good code’ in this module.
	</li>
	<li>
		Refactor CE1 until it reaches a high quality standard. Remember to consider feedback received from CE1
		code review. In particular,
	</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>
			Take into account the coding standards we have published (in the schedule page).
		</li>
		<li>
			We expect to see short and simple methods that follow SLAP.
		</li>
		<li>
			Also follow other practices recommended such as good naming and the right level of commenting.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<span class="highlighted">Note that those who don’t reach the expected code quality in CE2 may
		have to submit CE3 as well.</span>
	</p>
	<li>
		Add these additional functionality.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A sort command to sort lines alphabetically.
		</li>
		<li>
			A search command to search for a word in the file and return the lines containing that word.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		When adding above features, do it in TDD fashion.
	</li>
	Hints:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If you are new to unit testing, try adding some unit tests to existing CE1 functionality first before trying
			TDD. However, you are not *required* to add tests for existing CE1 functionality.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="highlighted">TDD is not simply ‘writing tests before writing functional code’.
			</span> Refer the demo in lecture 4 to find out how
			to TDD in small steps.
		</li>
		<li>
			When unit testing the ‘sort’ command, you can use existing ‘display’ and ‘add’ commands in the testing
			process. e.g., add a line, sort, display, and check if the display is sorted properly. This is not strict
			unit testing since we are not testing ‘sort’ functionality in isolation from other functionality, but it
			is acceptable since those other functions are also under your control and tested by you.
		</li>
		<li>
			Having a public method that takes the user command and executes it (CityConnect uses this
			approach) can greatly simplify the testing process. Then, you can write tests like this:
		</li>
		<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-java">//check if the “clear” command returns the right status message
assertEquals(“all content deleted from mytextfile.txt”,
TextBuddy.executeCommand(“clear”));
//check if the file was actually cleared
assertEquals(0, TextBuddy.getLineCount());</code></pre>
	</ul>
	<li>
		There is no need to test using input/output redirection method used in CE1. Instead, you should use a proper
		unit testing framework in CE2.
	</li>
	<li>
		Commit the code to your repo frequently, after each step in refactoring/TDD (e.g., add a test →
		commit → add code to pass the test → commit, and so on). Doing so will help us see the steps you followed during
		coding. <span class="highlighted">VisualStudio users: Avoid adding binary files</span> and temporary files to Git. These can
		make your repo too big. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4095696/mercurial-hgignore-for-visual-studio-2010-projects">
		here</a> for a list of file types you should not add.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>submission:</strong> Similar to CE1 except,
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Use <a href="../files/%5bTutorialGroupID%5d%5bYour%20full%20name%5d%5bCE2%5d%5bjava%5d.doc">
		this template</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Replace ‘CE1’ with ‘CE2’ in the file name.
	</li>
	<li>
		The zip file should Include the whole project folder which <span class="highlighted">
		should also contain the hidden .git folder</span>
		created by Git in addition to all source files (.java, .h, .cpp, .cs etc). But remember to remove binary
		files and other temporary files before submitting.
	</li>
	<li>
		Include <span class="highlighted">unit tests</span> as well (in both zip file and pdf file).
		However, there’s no need to include
		testInput.txt and expectedOutput.txt for CE2.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>evaluation:</strong> Similar to CE1 except.
</p>
<ul>
	<p>
		Points for code quality:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			On track (a reasonable submission) : 15 points
		</li>
		<li>
			Leading the class in quality : 18 points
		</li>
		<li>
			Code quality still needs significant catching up : 10 points
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Bonus points (added to the above):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Submitted on time : 1 points
		</li>
		<li>
			Followed exact submission format : 1 points
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Penalties
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			No evidence of effort, no attention paid to CE1 comments:
		</li>
		Submissions below what we consider “reasonable quality” will be penalized further based on the quality
		level. e.g. No evidence of applying the materials covered in the module. such as applying SLAP, following
		the given coding standard etc. Problems pointed out in CE1 comments still remain.
		<br>
		<li>
			Late submissions:
		</li>
		Submissions received more than 24 hours late will be penalized by -2 points per each 24 hours delayed beyond
		the first 24 hours.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Total points will be in the range of 0 - 20, most submissions are expected to earn 17.
	</p>
</ul>
