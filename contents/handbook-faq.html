<h3>Why the workload is so high?</h3>
<div id="faq-highWorkload">
  <p><img src="../images/Why workload heavy.png" width="378" height="340" /></p>
  <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, 
    CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some 
    of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore, we have to cover many essential SE 
    concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also 
    why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
  <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
  <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules 
    you do after this are going to be much heavier :-p<br />
    On the positive side, this module typically has a <span class="highlighted">higher average grade
  </span> than other modules.</p>
  <p><span class="highlighted">How to reduce the workload?</span> There are many activities worth 
    only bonus points and there are other optional activities that you can omit to reduce workload. 
    Those activities are useful only if you are aiming for a high-end SE career, CS2103 tutorships, 
    recommendation letters from the module lecturer, to enroll in selective modules (e.g. CS3216/7), 
    etc.</p>

<h3>Why so much bean counting?</h3>
<div id="faq-beanCounting">
  <p><img src="../images/small things matter.png" width="600" height="300" /></p>
  <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be 
    offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. 
    This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students forget this harsh reality when 
    they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work ethics. 
    That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission 
    instructions, arriving on time etc.).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of 
     the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

<h3>Why you force me to visit a separate website instead of using IVLE?</h3>
<div id="faq-separateWebsite">
  <p><img src="../images/Forces me to visit a separate website.png" width="655" height="271" /></p>
  <p>We have a separate website because some  the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.</p>
  <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant 
    information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always 
    expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <span class="highlighted">will remain 
    online</span> at<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/">
    http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>
