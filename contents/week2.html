                If you don't use a scheduling/task tracking tool (also known as GTD tools) to manage your schedules/tasks, start using one. There are many available (e.g. Google Calendar, Todo.txt, Fantastical, Wunderlist, Any.do, Remember The Milk, etc. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.priacta.com/Articles/Comparison_of_GTD_Software.php">here's</a> a long list).

                    Suggested workflow:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Team members take turns to read out the 'most important' user story remaining in their own pile of user stories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Others give comments about the user story.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yes - You would like to do implement this story before the end of the semester.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Maybe - It is something nice to have, but you may not have time to do it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No - It is not something you want to have in your product. Write the reason for rejection in the back of the paper.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        At the same time, others can cross out duplicate user stories and put them in the No pile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After all individual piles are transferred to the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles and share that information with all team members.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Define Jim:</b><br>
                        Decide our target user Jim's work patterns. e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others? (answer: no). Having a clear picture of Jim's work patterns will help when deciding the importance of a user story.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</b><br>
                        This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas you have about what your product will look like. Assume that you don't know what product you will built yet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</b><br>
                        At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story in the Yes pile turn out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always not implement it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</b><br>
                        Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for some potential users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</b><br>
                        For example, consider this user story:<br>
                        <em>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</em><br>
                        When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks should be considered 'needs my attention most at the present time'. Those details can be worked out later.
