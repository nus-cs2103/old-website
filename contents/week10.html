        Congrats to those who have set up Travis already. Although not compulsory, we highly recommend
        setting up Travis CI for your project. It will help you to detect bugs early and maintain a good test
        coverage. Refer to the
        <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/LearningOutcomes.md#use-continuous-integration-lo-continuousintegration" target="_blank">

        Similar to V0.2, but follow V0.3 requirements instead.
        In particular,
        <ul>
          <li>Do a 'release' on GitHub.
            <span class="highlighted">The release should include an executable jar file</span>. Refer the
          <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#making-a-release" target="_blank">

          <li>Update User Guide and Developer Guide. <br>
            Tips:
            <ul>
              <li>Each member is required to do a fair share of documentation. We recommend each student to
                maintain the developer docs and user docs for the components and features she is in charge of.
              </li>
              <li>If you use the <code>docs\diagrams\Diagrams.pptx</code> as the source for diagrams,
                you may want to split it into one pptx file per diagram to minimize merge conflicts

        Try to apply those heuristics in the test cases you write too. Add extra comments in your code
