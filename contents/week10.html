      <h3>Reach V0.2 [Team, 5pts]</h3>
      <div>
        This should be a working version that is better than the previous version in some way. 
        If required, update the project manual. For these intermediate milestones, the amount 
        of improvements between versions is not important. What matters is you moved the 
        product forward and everyone played a role in doing so. If your team is busy with 
        other modules, you can chose to do less (but you should do some), improvements. 
        But doing very little up to V0.4 and doing a lot in V0.5 is not acceptable.<br>

        Remember to <span class="highlighted">
        <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">git tag</a>
        your V0.1 and V0.2 in the repo.</span><br><br>

        <span class="highlighted">There should not be any pushing/pulling or tinkering with code
        during the tutorial.</span> You are expected to have a stable V0.2 version in the
         repo before you come in. This V0.2 may or may not be the latest code in the repo.<br>
        <br>
          Grading: 
          <ul>
            <li>2 points will be given for having a proper release. i.e. tagged as V0.2 in the repo, tagged version loaded into
              demo computer, and ready to start the demo.</li>
            <li>3 points will be given based on the progress of the product. Those that are ready to start

      <h3>Do some systematic unit testing [Individual, 2.5+2.5=5pts]</h3>
      <div>
        (a) [2.5 pts] Ensure at least some automated tests exist for your part of the code.<br>
        Note: If you are doing the GUI component, you might find it harder to do unit 
        testing in there. In that case, you can get some more work assigned to you 
        (e.g., writing a utility class) from somewhere else for which you can write unit tests. 
        The important thing is to show us that you can write unit unit tests. Locating a place 
        to do that is up to you.<br>
        <br>
        (b) [2.5 pts] Insert at least some comments in the code to explain the relation between your 
        test cases and the test case design heuristics covered in the lecture.<br>
        e.g., /* This is a <strong>boundary case</strong> for the ‘negative value’ <strong>partition</strong> */<br>
        Note: For some SUTs, it is not easy to identify partitions and boundaries. Try harder. 
        If still cannot, look elsewhere. The important thing is to show us that you can apply 
        test case design heuristics in practice. Locating a good example to do that is up to you.<br>
        During the tutorial you will be asked questions such as the below. Please read the relevant sections of the
        module handout to beef up your knowledge about test case design heuristics.
        <ul>
          <li>What is an <em>equivalence partition</em>?</li>
          <li>How does it help to improve E&E of testing?</li>
          <li>For a selected test case: What partition does this test input belong to? 
          What is another input from the same partition?</li>
          <li>What is a <em>boundary value</em>?</li>
          <li>and so on...</li>
