</p>
<p>
	<strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks
</p>
<ol type="a">

	<p>

	</li>
	<p>
		This is graded individually.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Graded based on following qualities of your own code.
		</li>

			</li>
			<li>
				Neatness and human readability.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Testing</strong> [max score: 7] - How good is your testing? Evaluated based on Q&A session,
		developer guide, code inspection, and an independent testing sessions by the TA. You may be asked to run
		your unit tests during the demo.
	</li>
	<p>
		Things that may be considered: number of bugs, level of test automation
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			How much effort you have invested in the testing process
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				[score: 1] Some effort on systematic testing.
			</li>
			<li>
				[score: 3] Comprehensive systematic testing with full automation.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			How well you have tested the product
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				[score: 2] Only minor bugs.
			</li>
			<li>
				[score: 4] No apparent bugs.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Expectations </strong>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Everyone is expected to write some code and write *some* tests. However, there is no need to write tests for
			all the code you write. This is to reduce your workload. It is sufficient if you write enough tests to prove
			your competency in testing. Note that in a production environment you are often required to have at least
			90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be much less.
		</li>
		<li>
			How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of
			testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required.
			Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the
			effort required.
		</li>
		<li>
			Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that
			you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to test
			the functional code because the code has low testability.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Documentation</strong> [max score: 8 ]- How well does your user guide and developer guide achieve their
		objectives? Evaluated based on the user guide and developer guide. Evaluated by lecturer and TA.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			User guide [max score: 3]
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				[score: 1] Barely good enough to get started.
			</li>
			<li>
				[score: 3] Top notch user guide, both as a quick start guide and a user manual.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Developer guide [max score: 5]
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				[score: 1] Barely enough to get started.
			</li>
			<li>
				[score: 3] Reasonable documentation, having most of these features
			</li>
			<li>
				Design described in two levels or more (opposite: single class diagram, only architecture diagram).
			</li>
			<li>
				Standard UML notation used in diagrams (opposite: invented your own notation, used ad hoc diagrams when
				there are UML alternatives).
			</li>
			<li>
				Diagrams and text complement each other (opposite: separate sections for different types of diagrams).
			</li>
			<li>
				Not too short or not too long. (opposite: too many unimportant stuff included, critical information
				missing).
			</li>
			<li>
				In the specified format (page header, front page etc.)
			</li>
			<li>
				[score: 5] Top notch developer guide. All above qualities are present. Neatly done.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<STRONG>Project management</STRONG> [max score: 5] - How well you followed the a systematic process to
		iteratively evolve
		the product, and schedule/track project progress, and spread the work uniformly across the semester with
		good buffers. We look for,
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Good version control, based on the repo.
		</li>
		<li>
			Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.
		</li>
		<li>
			Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)
		</li>
		<li>
			Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration)
		</li>

		<strong>Grading</strong>:
	</p>

		<li>
			[score: 2] Two of the above.

		<li>
			[score: 5] All of the above.

</ol>
<p>
	<strong>Penalty for late submission:</strong> <span class="highlighted">-1 mark for each hour delayed.</span>
	Even a 1-second delay is penalized,
	irrespective of the reason. Based on the time shown by IVLE.
