<p>
	This is a closed-door session, 30 minutes long, attended by evaluators and the team only.

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Demo</strong>: You get <span class="highlighted">15 minutes</span> to demo the product 
		using the executable submitted, on your own
		laptop, <span class="highlighted">using the projector or the TV</span>. The scenarios you 
		demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that
		you cover the full range of your product's functionality. It is recommended you showcase how the product
		improves the user’s workflow rather than simply describe each feature.
	</li>
	<span class="highlighted">No need to cover design/implementation details</span>. Rehearse 
	the steps well and ensure you can finish the demo
	within the 15 minutes.
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Dress code - Dress as if you represent a startup company giving a product demo at a technology conference.
			The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.
		</li>
		<li>
			Punctuality - automatic penalty for late arrival.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use of slides- Not recommended to use slides. If you do, use them sparingly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use of videos - discouraged. We prefer a live demo.
		</li>
		<li>
			Every team member should present some part of the product.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		15 minutes is barely enough to do the demo. Try to make the maximum use of the time in the following ways,
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You need to use the same version you submitted at V0.5. Use your own laptop to run it. Please be ready with your
			laptop running.
		</li>
		<li>
			As part of the demo, you will be asked to run your test suite. Please come ready with your IDE loaded with a copy
			of the V0.5 code.
		</li>
		<li>
			Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is a technical product demo, not a sales pitch or an
			informercial. You need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an
			imaginary user.
		</li>
		<strong>[Instead of this]</strong> Jim get’s a call from boss. “Ring ring”, “hello”, “oh hi Jim, can we 
		postpone the meeting?”
		“Sure”. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.
		<br>
		<strong>[do this]</strong> If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …
		<br>
		It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.
		<br>
		Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different requirements.
		<br>
		<li>
			If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don’t waste time repeating things the evaluator already knows. e.g., Jim’s workflow, the purpose of your
			product, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cover basic features first, and then cover the extra feature. This is to ease the grading process. The two
			are graded separately.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all
			the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of
			sample tasks creates a bad impression too.
		</li>
		<li>
			Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince
			that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with all
			the bells and whistles.
		</li>
	</ul>
