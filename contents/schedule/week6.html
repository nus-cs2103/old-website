      <h3>Pre-lecture activity</h3>
      <div>
        Give this problem a try (at least some thoughts) before coming to the lecture. We are going to do it as an exercise during the lecture (30 minutes).
        <br>
        <br>
        Imagine you are building an online system called <b>TeamFormer</b>. TeamFormer is a system for helping CS2103 students during team forming period. It lets students record who is in which team.
        Students can use the system to find teams short of members and students looking for teams, easing the team forming process.
        Note that the system is not meant as a platform for students to communicate with each other to find team members.
        Students are supposed to talk to each other and form teams outside the system, as they do now.
        TeamFormer simply helps students to see the team forming status of the class (e.g., who has teams and who don’t) and record their own team after forming a team.
        It is also meant to ease the team-forming-related workload of instructors.
        <br>
        <br>
        What should be the following elements of TeamFormer requirements?
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vision: {A short statement describing the product’s objective/direction}
          </li>
          <li>
            User types/roles: Students, Instructors, {any other user types?}
          </li>
          <li>
            High-level workflow: {In the process of team forming, who will do what first, and what will happen next, and so on? Where does TeamFormer fits into this workflow?}
          </li>
          <li>
            Scope: {What will TeamFormer do, and more importantly, what team-forming-related things it will NOT do?}
          </li>
        </ul>
        Specify important requirements of TeamFormer as a list of User Stories.
        <br>
        Write one use case (i.e., textual form) for one of the user stories that you think will result in the most complex user interaction.
        <br>
        Sketch a UI for TeamFormer.

            rather than slap together a slew of features that you as developers find
            interesting. UI prototypes are especially useful in visualizing the product
