                Inheritance is a powerful OO features that can be beneficial in certain design contexts.
                There are a few other nitty-gritties an OO guy should know such as class-level members.
                Sequence diagrams can be used to depict interactions between objects.

                      Overview: Testing should be done earlier and at lower levels without relying entirely on system testing or higher-level component testing.
                      API testing can be automated using testing frameworks such as JUnit.
                      TDD is a unique approach to ensure the testability of the component from the beginning and not as an afterthought.
