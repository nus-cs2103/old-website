        <strong> The three teams</strong>: <br>
        You will be in three different teams at different times of the semester.
      <ul>
        <li>Week 1 - 3: Phase A team</li>
        <li>Week 4 - 6: Phase B team</li>
        <li>Week 7 - 13: Phase C team (i.e. Project team)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phases A and B (Weeks 1 - 6) are the periods for strengthening individual competencies. By working with
        different teams during this period you get to know and learn from more classmates. The project is done
        in phase C. That means your Phase C team is also your project team.

<p><span class="highlighted">There cannot be any overlap between your 3 teams</span>. For example, any member from your
  Phase A team cannot be a member of your Phase B and C teams.</p>
</p>
<strong>When to form teams</strong>
<ul>
  <li>CS2103T: Your CS2101 team will be your CS2103T Phase C team as well. CS2101 team forming will be done by CS2101
    side during week 1. After that, you can form Phase A and Phase
    B teams on CS2103T side, avoiding any overlaps between the three teams.
  </li>
  <li>CS2103: Form tentative Phase A teams in week 2 (during the tutorial). Finalize phase A team in the subsequent
    tutorial. Form phase B team on week 4 and phase C team in week 5.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong> Team size</strong>: The default <span class="highlighted">team size is four</span>.
  Please do not form teams with five or more.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> Team ID</strong>: This will be given to you after forming teams in each phase. It has the form
  <code>TUTORIAL_ID-PHASE+TEAM_NUMBER</code> e.g, <code>W14-A2</code> means you are in
  tutorial W14 (i.e., Wed 1400-1500), phase A, team 2.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Additional requirements for Phase C team</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Roles and responsibilities:</strong> You need to elect one of your team members as
    the <span class="highlighted">team leader</span>. All members
    should be <span class="highlighted">put in charge of various aspects</span> of the project,
    as explained in <a href="#handbook-project-v00">V0.0 section</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Team composition</strong>: We allow some freedom in choosing team members,
    subject to these
    constraints:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Teams of <span class="highlighted">single nationality are not allowed</span>
        (rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams).
        However, we allow same nationality teams if the only language common among all team members is English.
        e.g. an all-Singaporean team that include both Chinese and Malay students.
      </li>
      <li>
        No more than one exchange students per team (rationale: to increase interaction between exchange
        students and NUS students).
      </li>
      <li>
        All team members should be in the same tutorial. <span class="highlighted">Delay forming teams until
        your place in a tutorial is confirmed.</span>
        We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Also note that we may modify teams when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object.
        Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.
