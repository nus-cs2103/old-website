<ul>
	<li>
		Project grades <span class="highlighted">will not be curved.</span> If you reach the given
		targets, you get the grade.
	</li>
	<li>
		You are given <span class="highlighted">individual project grades, not team grades.</span>
		Your project grade is based on how much you
		achieved as a team and how much you contributed toward that achievement.
		<span class="highlighted">We aim to match your grade to how
		much value you contributed to the project, NOT how good your team members are.</span>
		When measuring your
		contribution level, we consider:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Peer evaluations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Issues under your name in the issue tracker: We hope to see that you have contributed consistently
			(opposite: low contributions for long periods) and in a variety of tasks (opposite: limited yourself to
			only 1-2 types of tasks e.g. documentation).
		</li>
		<li>
			Revision history in the repo: We hope to see commits spread out through the project duration.
		</li>
		<li>
			Individual reports, if any.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Exam questions are very similar to the project work. <span class="highlighted">
		If your exam performance is drastically lower</span> than the
		project performance, project marks will be adjusted accordingly. This means teaming up with strong team
		members does not by itself get you a good project grade even if your team members are willing to let you
		‘freeride’.
	</li>
	<li>
		Some of you may be forced to contribute less than an equal share due to reasons of your own.
		<span class="highlighted">We have no problem
		with less-than-equal-share of contributions.</span> Those who are unable to contribute an equal share of the
		work will not get the same project grade as others in the team. Some situations where you are very likely to be
		penalized significantly:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			You did very little coding (note that each team member has to do a significant amount of coding).
		</li>
		<li>
			You insisted on doing almost all of the coding yourself (If you strongly feel that none of the other members
			write "good enough" code, please get permission from us before taking over the whole coding aspect).
		</li>
		<li>
			You regularly missed team meetings.
		</li>
		<li>
			You regularly failed to deliver what you promised.
		</li>
		<li>
			You often did not adhere to team decisions and regularly took critical decisions on your own without team
			consensus.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Note that <span class="highlighted">C++ projects will be graded separately from Java projects.
		</span> This is to account for the perceived
		difference in the learning curve in C++ technologies compared to Java.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="highlighted">CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects.
		</span> This is to account for the perceived
		difference in workload.
	</li>
</ul>
