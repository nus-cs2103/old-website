<div id = 'projectScope'>
<p>
	The scope of the project will be restricted. This is to reduce your workload and discourage an ‘arms race’
	where you try to implement as many features as possible with no time to spend on learning good software engineering
	principles and practices.
</p>
<p>
	Write the software to cater for Jim. He is an office worker who has an office computer (used when at office) and his
	personal laptop (used when at home or travelling). His computers are not shared by other colleagues or family members.
	He is not expected to use this software for collaborative work scheduling with others.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="highlighted">Narrowing/widening the scope of the project further is discouraged. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Must-have features:</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Support for events (i.e., has a start time and end time), deadlines (tasks that have to be done
			before a specific deadline), and floating tasks (tasks without specific times). Note that these category
			names are temporary names only. You should figure out what are the best names for these categories.
			Are these names intuitive to end-users? Should they even care about consciously categorizing tasks?
		</li>
		<li>
			CRUD (i.e., Create, Read, Update, Delete) support for tasks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Undo operations (at least for the most recent action)
		</li>
		<li>
			Some flexibility in the command format: Support a few natural variations of the command format.
		</li>
		<li>
			Simple search: A simple text search for finding an item if the user remembers some keywords from the
			item description.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some way to keep track of which items are done and which are yet to be done.
		</li>
		<li>
			The ability to specify a specific folder as the data storage location. With this feature,
			Jim can choose to store the data file in a local folder controlled by a cloud syncing service (e.g. dropbox),
			allowing him to access task data from multiple computers.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Extra features (choose one):</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Difficulty-low
	<ul>
		<li>
			AutomatedTesting : Achieve a very high level of automated testing.
		</li>
		<li>
			RecurringTasks: Support for managing recurring tasks. e.g. CS2103 lectures are a recurring task from week 1
			to week 13 except in recess week.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Difficulty-medium
	<ul>
		<li>
			PowerSearch : More powerful and intelligent search. e.g. search for empty slots, near-match search,
			auto-complete (similar to Google search box), filters for other attributes (e.g. start time).
		</li>
		<li>
			FlexiCommands: High flexibility in command format. e.g., non-strict ordering of keywords, ability
			to specify aliases for commands, support for more ‘natural’ language input, multiple undo/redo,
			How flexible should the format be? As flexible, intuitive, and user-friendly as you can make it.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Difficulty-high
	<ul>
		<li>
			GoodGui: A good GUI to give visual feedback to the user e.g., in-built guidance for new users, good visual
			feedback for actions, feedback while typing commands, hotkey to activate/hide, notifications, etc. conveying
			more information visually (e.g. more important/urgent tasks stand out from the rest, longer events look
			different from shorter events, easy to see free slots, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			GoogleIntegration: Google Calendar integration. e.g. upload todo items to GCal, two-way sync, Support for
			GCal quick add command format, etc. You may also use the Google Tasks API for this.
		</li>
		<li>
			Propose your own (subject to approval)
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Notes:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The number of marks allocated to the extra feature is the same, irrespective of the difficulty level.
			Choose Difficulty-medium or Difficulty-high buckets if you want to flex your SE muscles or to learn extra
			stuff (e.g. inegration with a Web app, GUI programming etc.). <span class="highlighted">Choosing higher
				difficulty buckets will not
			gain you more marks.</span> They are a way for you to go the extra mile.<br>
			Why bother doing those harder ones at all? In addition to the obvious benefits (i.e. learn more by doing more),
			doing those buckets can be beneficial when applying for CS2103 tutorships, applying for SE internships, or when
			requesting reference letters from Damith.
		</li>
		<li>
			Note that each of these extra features are “feature buckets”. You should pick a bucket and implement
			things that can be put in that bucket. Some things can be put in multiple buckets. For example, a GUI feature
			for auto-complete can be considered as in the PowerSearch bucket as well as in the GoodGui bucket.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="highlighted">Only one extra feature bucket will be considered for grading.</span> If you chose
			the GoodGui bucket but also
			implemented a basic integration with the Google Calendar, the latter will not earn marks unless it contributes
			to a better GUI.
		</li>
		<li>T
			he list of specific features given under each bucket is examples only and is non-exhaustive.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Unless you choose GoodGui as your extra feature, the product can be pure command line or have a simple GUI
	(i.e., just a text box and display area for output).
