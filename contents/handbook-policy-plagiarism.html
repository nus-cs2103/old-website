<div id = 'policy-plagiarism'>
<p>What's allowed:</p>
<p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class, not just a selected 
group. That is,</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
  <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, note that most submissions will be published to the class after the submission 
deadline, after which they <span class="highlighted">can be 'reused' by others</span> subject to 
the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
<p>If you submit code taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
<p>Detection: </p>
<p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or 
renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions are published to the class and sooner or 
later somebody notices the plagiarism.</p>
<p>Penalties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For activities earning participation points: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we 
  do not take further action. Because participation points are given for effort and all students 
  can earn the required 80% easily, such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. 
  Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better 
  rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, 
  go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
  <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be 
  reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>
</ul>
