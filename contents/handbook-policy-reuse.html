<div id = 'policy-reuse'>
<p>In general, <span class="highlighted">reuse is encouraged</span>. However, note that reuse has 
its own costs (such as the learning curve, additional complexity, usage restrictions, and unknown 
bugs). Furthermore, you will not be given credit for work done by others. Rather, you will be 
given credit for using work done by others.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>The work has been published by us.</li>
      <li>You clearly give credit to the original author(s).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>You are allowed to reuse work from external sources, subject to following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source 
	  project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.</li>
      <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources 
	  clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' 
	  menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble if you 
	  unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
      <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please <span class="highlighted">
	  do not use 3rd-party images/audio</span> in your software unless they have 
	  been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found it in the Internet does 
	  not mean it is free for reuse.</li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Always get permission from us before you reuse</span> things 
	  from elsewhere.Please post your 'request to use 3rd party library' in IVLE forum 
	  for approval. That way, the whole class get to see what libraries are being used by others.
