        <p>
            Pick task (a) or (b). Ensure at least one member picks each task
            and no more than one member picks the same concept/rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preferably, try to pick concepts/rules that you think
            are not applicable to the project.

              e.g. <i>product backlog, product owner,
              sprints, sprint backlog, daily scrum,
              user stories, scrumboard, story points,
              burndown charts, team velocity, scrum master</i>, etc.

            There is no need to bring any written answers;
            it is good enough if you can explain your answer verbally.
        </p>
        <p>
            <small>*“Relate” here means: Is it applicable in your project?
              If not, why not? Are you using something
              similar or an alternative in your project? etc.</small>

      <h3>Activity 2 [Team, 2pts]</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
            Find a platform, a framework, and a library you could have used in the project. One example
            each for the whole team is enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, all members should know those examples and why each one is considered a platform,
            a framework, or a library.

      <h3>Activity 4 - Mark &amp; Collate</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Mark your code and <span class="highlighted-darktext">try the <i>collate</i> tool</span>
          on it (we use the collate tool to extract out the code written
          by each of you, for grading purposes).
        </p>
        <p>
          For more info about the collate tool, see under the ‘V0.5 additional requirements’
          [link coming soon] section of the module handbook.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the collate tool cannot extract your code from the final submission, you are going
          to lose 10 marks from your final grade.
