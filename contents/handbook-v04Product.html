<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Freeze features</strong>: Consider V0.4 as a ‘release candidate’. i.e. it has all the features
		that we plan to release as V0.5. It is too risky to try to add more features in V0.5.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Use binaries</strong>: V0.4 demo should be done using the binary file (i.e. jar file or exe file),
		not using the IDE.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Ensure runnability</strong>: Copy your binary file to a fresh machine running 32bit Windows
		(e.g., a machine in a PL) and ensure it can be run there. What worked in the development environment (your
		Computer) might not work in another environment.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Mark your code</strong> with special tag @@author so that we can extract code written by each of
		you using the collate
		tool (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use the collate tool to extract individual code and look
		through the generated <strong> .md</strong> files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly.
		<span class="highlighted">Push the *.md files
		created to a folder called /collated</span> in your repo. More instructions below.
	</li>
	<p>
		<strong>Extract your code for code quality grading </strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Download the <a href="https://github.com/collate/collate" target="_blank">collate tool</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>. The comment syntax may vary
			based on file type e.g. for html
			<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-html"><<!--\-->!-- @@author matric-number --></code></pre>
		</li>
		<p>
			Here is a sample code file:
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...</code></pre>
		<li>
			The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code up to the next
			<code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that
			author.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who wrote most
			of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag should not appear inside a method.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product, you may use <code>//@@author
			matric-number-unused</code> to mark them.
		</li>
		e.g. <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
		Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.
		<br>
		<li>
			The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark *all* code you claim credit for.
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong> INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’ effort. e.g. comments,
				test code, documentation, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text
				that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong> Code you reused </strong>from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author
				matric-number-reused</code> 
			</li>
				e.g. <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
				where the matric number belongs to the person responsible for reusing that code.
			<li>
				<strong> EXCLUDE</strong> code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also mark such code
				<code>//@@author generated</code></li>
				e.g.
				<pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author generated
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
		</ul>
