<p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
<p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The 
collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) build up about SE issues related to 
the project become shallow and stretched too thinly.  It also affects fairness of grading.</p>
<p><img src="../images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296" /></p>
<p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses 
on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you 
can focus more on the creative side of software projects without being dragged down by 
nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like 
to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight 
variations of a given theme.</p>
<p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for 
creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you 
are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>
