<p>
    We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/"> TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system to conduct four
    rounds of peer-evaluations: after phase A, after phase B, middle of phase C, and end of phase C. <br>
    All four peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks.The system also
    allows
    you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.
</p>
<p>
    The 3rd and 4th peer evaluations will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the
    project.
    In those peer-evaluations, you will be asked to <span class="highlighted">estimate the contribution of each team member</span>
    (including yourself) to the project so far.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="highlighted">Rounds 3 and 4 may affect your grade</span> in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we award grades based on the
        contribution levels submitted through the peer evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than
        others, you get more marks.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g., you say you did an [equal share + 20%]
        while
        your team says you did an [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project marks. For
        such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to <span class="highlighted">
    submit an additional individual report</span> to itemize and quantify the contribution to the project.
        <span class="highlighted"> Overclaimers will be penalized.</span> Please do not claim high just to ‘see how’.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Peer evaluations are <span class="highlighted">not visible to undergraduate tutors.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="highlighted">If you disagree with the team’s opinion</span>, i.e., you think the perceived contribution
    is significantly different from what you actually contributed, you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an
    individual report (‘individual report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).
</p>
<p>
    Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on team member perceptions and may not reflect
    your real contribution. <span class="highlighted">We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.</span>
</p>
<p>
    You may <span class="highlighted">ignore minor variations</span> in the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES.
    For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due
    to rounding off within the system.
</p>
<p>
    Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when
    one’s own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived
    contribution’ to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to make your views known to the team,
    please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more
    rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle
    such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even
    deliberate sabotage.

            <p> A final note on this issue : </p>
            <span class="highlighted">Please be sincere about how much you can do from the beginning</span>, rather than
            let
            your
            team members figure it out over the long run. Tell them how much you can do and what kind of work you are
            willing
            to
            do. If you are not open about it, they will still figure it out at the end; they will still report it (via
            the
            peer-evaluations), and your score will be adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand can
            save
            everyone a lot of frustrations, unpleasantness, and bitterness. </p></td>
