	We use the online peer evaluation system <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/">
	TEAMMATES</a> to
	 conduct three rounds of <span class="highlighted">peer-evaluations</span> to
	determine the level of contribution from each member. During peer-evaluations, you will be asked to
	<span class="highlighted">estimate the contribution of each team member</span> 
	(including yourself) 
	to the project so far. The system also
	allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.
</p>

<p>
	Peer evaluation round 1 will be used to give early feedback to those who the team thinks are ‘not
	contributing enough’. This round will not affect your grade.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="highlighted">Rounds 2 and 3 may affect your grade</span> in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we award grades based on the
		contribution levels submitted through the peer evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than
		others, you get a higher grade.
	</li>
	<li>
		If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g., you say you did an [equal share + 20%]
		while your team says you did an [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project
		grades. For such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to <span class="highlighted">
		submit an additional individual
		report</span> to itemize and quantify the contribution to the project. <span class="highlighted">
		Overclaimers will be penalized.</span> Please do
		not claim high just to ‘see how’.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Peer evaluations are <span class="highlighted">not visible to undergraduate tutors.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="highlighted">If you disagree with the team’s opinion</span>, i.e., you think the perceived 
	contribution is significantly
	different from what you actually contributed, you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an individual
	report (‘individual report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).
</p>
<p>
	Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on team member perceptions and may
	not reflect your real contribution. <span class="highlighted">We use those numbers primarily to 
	identify cases that need further
	investigation.</span>
</p>
<p>
	You may <span class="highlighted">ignore minor variations</span> in the contribution numbers reported 
	by TEAMMATES. For example, the
	difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to
	rounding off within the system.
</p>
<p>
	Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when
	one’s own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived
	contribution’ to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.
</p>
<p>
	If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to make your views known to the team,
	please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more
	rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle
	such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even
	deliberate sabotage.
</p>
<p>
	A final note on this issue :
</p>
<p>
	<span class="highlighted">Please be sincere about how much you can do from the beginning</span>, 
	rather than let your team members figure it
	out over the long run. Tell them how much you can do and what kind of work you are willing to do. If you are not
	open about it, they will still figure it out at the end; they will still report it (via the
	peer-evaluations), and your score will be adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand can
	save everyone a lot of frustrations, unpleasantness, and bitterness.
