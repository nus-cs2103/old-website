            You should have received<br>
            (a) at least one peer code review AND<br>
            (b) comments about SLAP from your tutor. If that is not the case, please inform your tutor.

          <li>
            Don't get upset if the reviews you received seem 'wrong' or 'contradictory'. 
            If you are sure a point in the review is wrong, just ignore it. 
            If you are not sure yourself, you can get the opinion of your team members before deciding to reject it.

            Please <span class="highlighted">do not contact the peer reviewer to respond</span> to the review.  
            While such follow up discussions are part of real code reviews, at this time we do not have enough resources

            If you find something in your peer code review that you consider 'offensive', please inform lecturer for

            If you haven't already, do start CE2. If you have already done CE2, you may wish to refactor further based on

            You may wish to break bigger tasks into smaller manageable size. For example, you can designate a big user story

            Tip: create one panel for each team member and use the assignee:username filter to show issues assigned

            Learning how to use Git remote repos: This can be a bit overwhelming if you are totally new to RCS. 
            We recommend you learn incrementally, coming back to these learning resources as you use Git. 
            Feel free to request for help in IVLE forums.
