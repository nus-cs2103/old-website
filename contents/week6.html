            You may wish to break bigger tasks into smaller manageable size. For example, you can designate a big user story

            Tip: create one panel for each team member and use the assignee:username filter to show issues assigned 
            for a specific member in each panel (see screenshot below). You can save this board for future use.

            Learning how to use Git remote repos: This can be a bit overwhelming if you are totally new to RCS. 
            We recommend you learn incrementally, coming back to these learning resources as you use Git. 
            Feel free to request for help in IVLE forums.
