      <h3>[individual, 2pts] Do an OOP design for your component</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          In a previous tutorial, you designed the architecture for your product. As we are following a
          top-down approach, the next step is to design each of the components in the architecture. In other
          words, now that we know what the ‘big boxes’ in your design are, we need to figure out what are
          inside those big boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design (or refine previous design) of your own component using OO. This design need not match the
          current code. The code can be refactored to match the design later. If you haven’t done it already,
          define the detailed API for main components. Things to note:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The design of each component should be a separate diagram. <span class="highlighted">Do not draw a
            single diagram with all the classes of the entire product in it.</span><br>
            <span class="dimmed">Rationale: We are training you to build big systems where one diagram cannot
            contain all details of the entire design. You need to learn how to design one component at a time.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            The design of a component is <span class="highlighted">a class diagram</span> that show the
            structure of the component. It can be supplemented using object diagrams (to show object
            structures at various points at run time) and sequence diagrams (to show how objects interact
            within the component). Do not use other non-standard diagrams/notations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here’s a pictorial view of how component designs should look like:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/component designs.png" style="width: 525.00px; height: 328.00px;">
        <p>
          When coming to the tutorial, bring the class diagram (and object diagrams and sequence diagrams, if
          any) for your component design. Hand-drawn rough sketches are acceptable.
          If you component has only one class, bring the precise API definition of that component.
          If you are in charge of a UI component and it has only one class, bring the definition of APIs the
          UI is supposed to call.

      <h3>[individual, 1pts] Practice with the remote repo</h3>
      <div>
        Start using GitHub repo. Each member should push code to the team repo at least once. Don’t worry
        about messing up the repo. This is just for practice. You can reset/overwrite the repo if it gets
        messed up.

      <h3>[individual] Update issue tracker with all the project tasks you have done so far</h3>

          This is for you to practice defining tasks and recording them for better visibility. Also enter
          tasks that you plan to do in the next week. This plan can be revised during the tutorial. Remember
          to ‘close’ completed issues and milestones.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have many ‘ongoing’ issues but no ‘completed’ issues for the past week, that means your
          issues are too big. Break them into smaller parts. Reminder: read

          We ask you to draw the diagrams again (even though you have brought diagrams drawn at home)
          <span class="highlighted">to give you more practice in on-the-spot hand drawing of minimalistic
          diagrams to aid discussion</span>, which is different from drawing detailed diagrams to document
          the design. When drawing quick diagrams for discussion, <span class="highlighted">avoid adding
          unnecessary details</span>. For example, you can omit properties and methods in the class
          diagram, unless it is an API exposed to other components. Refer the digram below for an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlighted">Do not draw a one giant diagram</span> with all the details. Instead, draw
          separate diagrams for each component, as shown above.

        <p>
          When explaining, <span class="highlighted">do not try to explain the program flow using class
          diagrams</span>. Class diagrams are structure diagrams, not behavior diagrams. If you want to
          explain program flow, you should use sequence diagrams.

            Logging: You are required to do *some* logging by V0.3. However, it is enough to use normal file
            I/O to write to a log file (similar to how you did file I/O in CE1/2). <span class="highlighted">
            Using a logging frameworks is optional</span>.

                C++: While there are a few C++ logging frameworks available (e.g.,

                Boost-log</a>), they look rather complicated. You may be better off using direct file I/O for
                writing to a log file.
