      <h3>T6A1. Get started on the project requirements and design <img src="../images/star.png"/></h3>
      <div>
        <p>In parallel to other T6 activities you will do with your current Phase B team members,
          get together <span class="highlighted">with your Phase C team members</span> and start drafting V0.0 deliverables.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Suggested sequence</strong> : document product survey --> document user stories --> prioritize use stories -->
          select user stories to include in your product --> design the product --> write the user guide <br>
          Fill up Glossary and NFRs in parallel to the above.
        </p>
        <p>You may use a simple collaboration medium such as Google Docs for the above. You can transfer the content to
          your GitHub repo at a later point after the content is somewhat stable. Given that you will be converting the
          document to Markdown later, minimize effort spent on formatting.</p>
        <p>
          Submission: Submission will be in Week 8 (after converting to markdown and pushing to the repo).
          In tutorial 7, just show your intermediate drafts to the tutor.

        <p>You may also set up (this can be done in week 8 too) GitHub organization for your Phase C, as described
