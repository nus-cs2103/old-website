<p><strong>[ You . Together . Continuously . Reach ]</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The product is you, NOT what you build.</p>
<p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module. 
This means,</p>
<ul>
  <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. We take the 
  route that allows you to learn the most.</li>
  <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority 
  (although we try to do a bit of that too). Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy 
  of, high quality software engineering work is our priority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just much you've done, but also, how well 
you've done those things.</p>
<p>Here are some of the aspects in which we try to make you more professional:</p>
<p> </p>
<table class="bordered" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>We appreciate ...</strong></p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>But we value more ...</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to deal with minute details</p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to abstract over details, generalize, see the big 
	  picture</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>A drive to learn latest and greatest technologies</p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to make the best of given tools</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to find problems that interest you and solve them
	  </p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to solve the given problem to the best of your 
	  ability</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to burn the midnight oil to meet a deadline</p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to schedule work so that the need for 'last 
	  minute heroics' is minimal</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Preference to do things you like or things you are good at
	  </p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to buckle down and deliver on important things that 
	  you don't necessarily like or aren't good at</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to deliver desired end results</p></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ability to deliver in a way that shows how well you 
	  delivered (i.e. visibility of your work)</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>We learn together, NOT compete against each other.</strong></p>
<p>You are not in a competition. Our grading is not forced on a bell curve.</p>
<p>Learn from each other. That is why we publish submissions.</p>
<p>Teach each other, even those in other teams. Those who do it well can become tutors next time.</p>

<p><strong>Continuously engage, NOT last minute heroics.</strong></p>
<p>We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does 
not require 'last minute heroics'.</p>
<p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute 
mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>

<p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
<p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. 
Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what 
you knew to begin with. The full 10% allocated to intermediate deliverables is within the reach 
of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>
