<p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will show you the way, but 
absorbing content is to be done at your own pace, by yourself. In this module, we still tell you 
what content to study and also pass most of the content to you. After you graduate, you have to 
decide what to study and find your own content too.</p>
