<h3>V0.2 Product</h3>
This is the first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the product.
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="highlighted">It should be a viable, possibly minimal product</span>.
    This is not a walking skeleton. A user should be able to use
    it. It may not be user-friendly, but it should not be unusable. Try to include at least the basic CRUD
    facilities for at least one type of tasks. Here are some examples that are NOT acceptable:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not support commands for deleting or
      editing tasks: This is not usable because the user cannot rectify errors made while creating tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not connected to the UI: This too is not
      usable by the end-user.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    While this is an internal release (not a production release), <span class="highlighted">you are expected to
    maintain a reasonable code quality at all times</span>. In particular, you should comply with the coding standard
    all the time.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging" target="_blank">git
  tag</a> as <code>V0.2</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should have reached the MVP stage.<br>

<h3>V0.2 Documentation</h3>
<p>
  You are encouraged to update your project documentation to match the product but you are not required to submit them
  for evaluation. Note that this flexibility is given solely to reduce your workload. In a production environment, the
  documentation should always be kept in sync with the product.

<h3>V0.2 Demo</h3>
<p>
  As before, show the demo to the tutor during the tutorial.<br>
  The demo should use the version tagged as <code>V0.2</code>, not the latest code. No tinkering with code
  during the tutorial.
