<p>Intermediate submissions are also incremental submissions. Intermediate submissions are 
included in the final submission too and will earn marks at that point. They are there to help you 
do well in the final submission and for us to monitor your progress and guide you accordingly. 
They are a means to an end. They are not achievements themselves. By right, they shouldn't 
be given marks at all. :-)</p>
