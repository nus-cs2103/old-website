<p>
	Tutorial time is the main avenue for meeting your tutor who is also your project supervisor. In addition,
	you can meet the tutor before/after the tutorial, or any other time, as many times you need, subject to
	availability in his/her schedule. However, please note that it is not the tutor’s job to chase you down and
	give help. It is up to you to get as much feedback from the project tutor as you need.
