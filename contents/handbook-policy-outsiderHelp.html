<p>In general, you are <span class="highlighted">not allowed to involve outsiders</span> in your 
project except your team members and the teaching team. However, It is OK to give your product to 
others for the purpose of getting voluntary user feedback. It is also OK to learn from others as 
long as they don't do your project work themselves.</p>
