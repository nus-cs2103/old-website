	In this semester, we build a scaled-down version of ‘a Siri for keyboards’. i.e. a tool that can accept
	natural language commands via keyboard. This is for folks who can type fast, spend most of the time near
	a computer, and prefer typing over mouse/voice commands.
</p>
<p>
	It is ‘scaled down’ in the following ways:
	<ol>
		<li>It handles only commands related to managing ‘todo’ tasks.</li>
		<li>The commands will not be truly ‘natural language’. The command format will be flexible, but still
		quite structured. NLP (Natural Language Processing) is not required.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Problem outline</strong>: We are bombarded with ‘things to do’ continuously. Some things need to be
	done during specific times (e.g., attend meeting), some have deadlines (e.g., submit report), and others are
	simply ‘to be done someday’ (e.g., read ‘Lord of the Rings’).  The pile of todo items accumulates and weighs
	heavily on our mind at times. Sometimes things go out of control and we forget to do certain things on time.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Solution outline</strong>: The software should help user to put these todo items into a systematic
	process that tracks them and helps the user to decide what to do and when to do things so that the user
	doesn’t have to remember the todo items.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Target audience</strong>: There are many similar software that tackles some aspect of this problem
	(todo lists software, calendar software, GTD software). Because it is a crowded product space, our strategy
	is to become a niche player by targeting a specific user group. Our target users are people Jim whose workflow
	is described below.
</p>
<img src="../images/Jim at his computer.png" style="width: 500px;">
<p>
	Most of Jim’s todo items arrive as emails. This is how Jim processes his emails.
	<ol>
		<li>Decides what the follow up action required by that email.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If it can be done immediately, he does it right away (e.g., just reply to the email) and ‘archive’
			the email (i.e. move it out of inbox).</li>
			<li>If it cannot be done immediately, he schedules the follow up action in his calendar and archives
				the email. If he cannot decide a good time to do the action, he simply schedules it in a relatively free
			area in his calendar.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>When Jim is free to do some work, he looks at his calendar and picks up something that he can do at
			that time. Once the task is done, he marks it as ‘done’. If there is a further follow up action required,
		he schedules it in the calendar. </li>
		<li>Jim periodically reviews the calendar to pick items that could not be completed and need to be
		rescheduled or discarded as ‘cannot do’.</li>
		<li>Todo items not arising from email are dealt similarly by entering them in the calendar.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see from the above workflow, Jim’s inbox is almost empty most of time (cf Inbox Zero).
	He no longer worries about an inbox full of emails he has to deal with at any time he login to email.
	He also does not have to keep any todo items in his mind because everything is recorded somewhere.
	However, here are some ‘pain points’ in his workflow.
	<ul>
		<li>Jim is currently using Google calendar. Because he store/retrieve/edit todo tasks so frequently,
			he find the online calendar too slow to work with. He’d rather have a desktop software he can summon
			quickly. Even better (but not a must) if he can activate the software by pressing a keyboard shortcut.
		He is quite impressed by how the <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy tool can be activated 
		easily by pressing Alt+Space</a>.</li>
		<li>A calendar is not very good in capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time,
		or after a specific date/time, and items without specific times.</li>
		<li>Entering an event in a calendar is a pain because it takes several clicks.  He prefers a ‘one shot’
			approach. e.g., to be able to type in commands such as "add July 10, 5-6, project meeting"
		(such as allowed by <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/72143?rd=1">GCal’s ‘quick 
		add’ feature</a>). </li>
		<li>While it is good that all Jim’s todo items are currently online and available to access from any
			computer, he always uses his own laptop or office PC to access them and sometimes from places where
		there is no ready Internet connectivity. </li>
		<li>Jim finds it a pain to do certain things important to his workflow but not so important in a
			regular calendar. e.g. looking for suitable slot to schedule an item, marking an item as done, deciding
		what todo item to do next, postponing an item.</li>
		<li>A calendar does not have an easy way to “block” multiple slots when the exact timing of a task is
			uncertain, and release the blocked slots when the time is finalized. e.g., Block Mon 2-3pm and Tue 2-3pm
		for a meeting with boss → the meeting is confirmed for Tue → automatically release Mon slot.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	
	Design your product to solve some of Jim’s problems to make his workflow even more efficient and painless. i.e.
	to make his life better. You don’t have to solve all problems mentioned above and there may be other problems you
	could solve but not mentioned above. Good software delights users by solving problems users don’t even realize they have.
	You can also draw inspiration from the <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt project</a>, but try to do 
	better.
