	<strong>Communication</strong>:
</p>
<p>
	Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do
	at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., via an email group such as
	GoogleGroups) to practice how to communicate technical things in written form.
</p>
<p>
	You are also encouraged to add your supervisor to whichever communication mechanism you use. e.g.
	GoogleGroups.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: We are going to <span class="highlighted">use GitHub as 
	the hosting and collaboration
	platform</span> of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). 
	See <a href="#handbook-appendixE">
	Appendix E</a> for more
	info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>IDE</strong>: We <span class="highlighted">require you to use 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> (latest stable release) 
	or <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/product/product.aspx?productid=101">VisualStudio (version
	2012 recommended but you may use a different version if everyone in the team agrees</a>)</span> 
	(<a href="https://docs.comp.nus.edu.sg/node/1282">more info on how to get
	it</a>) for module related programming work. Since all team members will work on the same code base and project
	tutors too have to go through the code for testing and evaluation, it is troublesome to use multiple IDEs.
	Furthermore, when everyone uses the same tool, it creates a bigger collective know-how about the tool
	which makes troubleshooting easier and the productivity higher.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Revision control</strong>:
</p>
<p>
	You are required to use Git. Other revision control software are not allowed.
</p>
<p>
	The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>, 
	but you may use any other, or none.
