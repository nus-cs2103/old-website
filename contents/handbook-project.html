<p>
  CS2103 project is structured to resemble the initial stages of a non-trivial real-life software project.
  In this project you will conceptualize a product and build a scaled-down version of the product,
  and <span class="highlighted">have it ready to be continued by someone else</span>.
</p>
<p>To expedite your project implementation, you will be given some sample code that you can use as the basis for your
  project.</p>
