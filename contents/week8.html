      <h3>Relate Coupling and Cohesion to your component [Individual, 2pts]</h3>
      <div>
        Try to relate coupling and cohesion to the current architecture or the design of your component.
        Where can you improve those two aspects?
        Think of an alternative design and try to explain the difference between your design and the
        alternative design using coupling and cohesion.
        You will be asked about this during the tutorial.
        <br>
        Recommended: Bring two design diagrams to the tutorial -- one representing the current design 
        of your component and the other representing an alternative design.<br>
        If you component has only one class, you can try to come up with an alternative that has multiple classes. 
        The alternative can be worse or better than the current design. The important thing is you can 
        compare the two in terms of coupling and cohesion. <br>
        The diagrams should be <span class="highlighted">proper UML diagrams</span>: class diagrams (if you plan to compare 
        the two in terms of structure) or sequence diagrams (if you plan to compare in terms of behavior).<br>
        Here is an example (also note how the two class diagrams omit lower level details such as methods):<br>

      <h3>Update the project plan in the issue tracker [Individual, 2pts]</h3>
      <div>
        Update the issue tracker with all the project tasks you have done so far. Also enter tasks that you plan
        to do in the next week. This plan can be revised during the tutorial.
        All issues allocated to V0.1 and prior milestones should be closed. If any are not done yet,
        reschedule them to future milestones.
        A person should typically have some closed issues (in V0.1 milestone) and some open issues
        (in the upcoming milestones) against his/her name at this point. Status of those issues should be
        updated accordingly.

          far behind and feel like you cannot catch up, please let your tutor know, or email the lecturer.
          We’ll try to help you catch up.

      <h3> Demo V0.1 [Team]</h3>
      <div>
        Do a demo of your V0.1 to your tutor. It is an informal demo to show what you have done so far.
        This demo can be done by one person. We expect you to take turns in doing the demo. Those who did not
        do the demo this time are expected to demo in future weeks.
        This is a live demo (i.e. use the actual product for the demo).
        <br/>
        Demo duration ~5min.
        No need for slides.

        Note: If you don’t have neat (can be hand drawn, but should be neat) diagrams for your architecture
        and component designs at this stage, it is a sign that you are simply hacking together code and there
        is no effort to follow a design.

        Use HubTurbo to show the milestone plan to the tutor.

      <h3>Can relate coupling and cohesion to a design.</h3>
      <div>
        You should be able to justify some design decisions using the concepts coupling and cohesion.
        e.g. We chose design 1 over design 2 for the Parser component because in design 1 the Parser does not 
        execute commands, which makes it more cohesive.

            Singleton is a neat pattern and it is easy to explain too. That is why it is used often to
            illustrate  the concept of design patterns. However, there is a concern that Singletons are evil,
            especially when used excessively.
