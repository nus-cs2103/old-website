        <ul>
          <li> Go through the worked examples in handouts</li>
          <li>Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did</li>
          <li>Explore other extra features, not just the one your team did<br />
      </li>

<p>Note that CS2103 paper measures how well you can apply the theory to a project. 
Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how you  applied theory in the 
project. The exam will be easy for you if you attend lectures, participate in tutorials(tutorials 
too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project. 
However, <span class="highlighted">you will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past 
papers just before the exams.</span></p>
