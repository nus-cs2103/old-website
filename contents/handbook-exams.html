        handouts, and tutorials.
    </li>

      format (and examiner's comments) can be found <a href="../files/exampapers/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Attend the last two lecture to learn more about the exam paper.</li>
    <li>Exam consultations (consultations near the exam) are discouraged but allowed. We

    </li>
    <li>Study tips:
        <ul>
            <li> Go through the worked examples in handouts</li>
            <li>Learn all parts of the project, not just the part you did</li>
            <li>Explore how your project can be extended to support more features<br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>Note that CS2103 paper measures how well you can apply the theory to a project.
    Therefore, the exam is strongly connected to the project and how you Â applied theory in the
    project. The exam will be easy for you if you attend lectures, participate in tutorials(tutorials
    too are focused on application of theory to the project), and do a sincere job in the project.
  <span class="highlighted">You will not be able to ace the exams by simply doing past
papers just before the exams.</span></p>
