<p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the 
semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning 
effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application of theory' (i.e., 
project work) evenly across the semester.</p>
