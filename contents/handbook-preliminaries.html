    <strong>Where is everything?</strong> CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="schedule.html">The Schedule page</a></strong> (organized chronologically): 
        <span class="highlighted">That is the one page you need to refer weekly</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Module handbook</strong> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary 
        to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, 
        <span class="highlighted">skim through it quickly to learn what it contains</span>. You can come back to read 
        details as-and-when you need those details. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you 
        should read at various points.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>No reminder emails</strong>: We try to minimize sending module details via announcements. 
    The reason will be explained in lecture 1. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</strong>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. If not specifically 
    mentioned, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What did seniors say about this module?</strong> CS2103/T is <strong>practical</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> module, but also a 
    <strong>heavy</strong> and <strong>intensive</strong> module, as you can see from 
    <a href="../files/CS2103 student feedback 2013 Aug.pdf" target="_blank">student feedback for a recent offering of the module</a>.
