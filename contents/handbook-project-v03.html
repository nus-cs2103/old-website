<h3>V0.3 Product</h3>
<p>This version should be a more functional version than V0.2 and should contain at least a basic version of features
  you intend to release in the final version.</p>
<p>Ideally, V0.3 should be good enough for
  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dogfooding%20(to%20dogfood)" target="_blank">dog fooding</a>.
  Try to reach a dogfooding-ready version of the 'must have' features at least.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Release using GitHub's release mechanism. The release should include an executable JAR

<h3>V0.3 Documentation</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v03-documentation"></div>
<p>
  Follow the documentation in the sample project in terms or organization, level of details, etc.
<ul>
  <li>Update User Guide to match what you plan to deliver at V0.5</li>
  <li>Update Developer Guide to match your current design or the design you plan to have at V0.5.
    Here are some things you can add:
    <ul>
      <li>Compare the current design with other alternative designs possible.</li>
      <li>Add more descriptions e.g. show at least one interaction within each component.</li>
      <li>Use object diagrams to show sample object structures at runtime (if it helps the reader).</li>
      <li>Explain how you implemented complicated features such as undo/redo.</li>
      <li>In future (after these topics have been covered):<br>
        * Use Activity Diagrams and OO Domain Models where applicable. <br>
        * Mention where design patterns/principles are applied.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
