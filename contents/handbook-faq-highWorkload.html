<p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4, 
CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some 
of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore, we have to cover many essential SE 
concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also 
why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
<p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
<p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules 
you do after this are going to be much heavier :-p<br />
On the positive side, this module typically has a <span class="highlighted">higher average grade
</span> than other modules.</p>
<p><span class="highlighted">How to reduce the workload?</span> There are many activities worth 
only bonus points and there are other optional activities that you can omit to reduce workload. 
Those activities are useful only if you are aiming for a high-end SE career, CS2103 tutorships, 
recommendation letters from the module lecturer, to enroll in selective modules (e.g. CS3216/7), 
etc.</p>
