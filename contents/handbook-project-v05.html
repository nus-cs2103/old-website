<h3>V0.5 Demo</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v05-demo"></div>
<p>
  Duration: 12 minutes. Schedule: During your week 13 tutorial slot.
</p>
<img src="../images/v05demo.png" style="width: 250px">
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> Demo</strong>: You get <span class="highlighted">12 minutes</span> to demo the product
    using the executable submitted, on your own laptop, <span class="highlighted">using the projector or the TV</span>.
    The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's
    functionality. It is recommended you showcase how the product improves the user’s workflow rather than simply
    describe each feature.
  </li>
  <span class="highlighted">No need to cover design/implementation details</span>. Rehearse the steps well and ensure
  you can finish the demo within the 12 minutes.
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Dress code - Dress as if you represent a startup company giving a product demo at a technology conference.
      The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress at the same level.
    </li>
    <li>
      Punctuality - automatic penalty for late arrival.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use of slides- Not recommended to use slides. If you do, use them sparingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use of videos - discouraged. We prefer a live demo.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    12 minutes is barely enough to do the demo. Try to make the maximum use of the time in the following ways,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Venue:</strong>The venue is as same as the tutorial venue. You will be using the TV for the demo.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time, divided among the 4 teams as follows.<br>
      <code>Team C1: 00-15 minutes, C2: 15-30 minutes, C3: 30-45 minutes, C4: 45-60 minutes</code><br>
      At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead of the allocated time to set up your computer.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing: </strong>
      All team member should remain in the holding area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo)
      because our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.<br>
      Holding area for Active Learning Room: Unused area of the room (enter by the door near the staircase)<br>
      Holding area for SR5: Tables outside SR5
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to use the same version you submitted at V0.5. Use your own laptop to run it. Please be ready with your
      laptop running.
    </li>
    <li>
      As part of the demo, you will be asked to run your test suite. Please come ready with your IDE loaded with a copy
      of the V0.5 code, on a different computer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is a technical product demo, not a sales pitch or an
      informercial. You need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an
      imaginary user.
    </li>
    <strong>[Instead of this]</strong> Jim get’s a call from boss. “Ring ring”, “hello”, “oh hi Jim, can we
    postpone the meeting?”
    “Sure”. Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing ..etc.
    <br>
    <strong>[do this]</strong> If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …
    <br>
    It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it.
    <br>
    Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different requirements.
    <br>
    <li>
      If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don’t waste time repeating things the evaluator already knows. e.g., Jim’s workflow, the purpose of your
      product, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast).
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all
      the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of
      sample tasks creates a bad impression too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince
      that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with all
      the bells and whistles.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
