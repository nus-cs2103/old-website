<p><span class="highlighted">To earn full 10 marks, you should earn 200 participation points
</span> . 190 points → 9 marks, 180 points → 8 marks, …and so on, until 109 points or fewer  → 0 
marks.</p>
<p>Every week you'll be given various opportunities to earn points. There will be 
opportunities to earn more than 300 points (about 250 regular points + about 50 bonus points), 
so earning 200 of them should not be difficult. <br />
Note: Regular points are given based on effort. If you put in a reasonable effort, you get the 
points irrespective of the quality of the outcome. They are not based on your skill level. Bonus 
points are extra points you can earn if you go the extra mile.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Points for module work</strong>: Here are the many ways to earn participation points, and maximum 
  participation points for each.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Lecture participation [1 point per SMS answer/participation vouchers, 0.1 point per 
  SMS/voucher beyond 3 points. Max points per lecture: ~3] e.g., If you answered 4 SMS questions 
  and earned one voucher, you get 1+1+1+0.1+0.1=3.2 (the 0.2 is just to acknowledge you did more 
  than required; it is unlikely to affect your grade).</li>
  <li>Post-lecture quizzes on IVLE [3/quiz]</li>
</ul>
<p>Marking scheme for MCQ questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(max-1) .. (max) marks →  3 participation points</li>
  <li>(max-4) .. (max-2) marks →  2 participation points</li>
  <li>0-(max-5) marks → 1 participation points</li>
</ul>
<p>You <span class="highlighted">can attempt the quiz any number of times. We count only the 
best attempt</span>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tutorial activities [~5/tutorial, See the 'Tutorials' section above to see how 
  this is calculated]</li>
  <li>Coding exercises: CE1 [15++] CE2 [15++] CE3 [5]. See the relevant sections above for how 
  these are calculated.</li>
  <li>Peer evaluations: [5/round - If submitted on time with reasonable constructive feedback 
  for team members]</li>
  <li>Intermediate project submissions: V0.0 - V0.4: [~15 per version, more details in the 
  Schedule page].</li>
  <li>Other ad hoc opportunities offered during the module (e.g., submit a survey, in-lecture 
  activities).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>eXperience Points (XP)</strong>: Here is one more way to earn bonus points:
    <p>Objective: To recognize and encourage self-initiated SE-related work that can help you become 
    a better Software Engineer. These things will also give you an edge at job interviews.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Forager: Has taken part in a public developer forum, by asking questions [+1pt] or 
      answering questions [+2pts].<br />
      Expected evidence: Links to some of your posts in the forum. Non-trivial IVLE posts are 
      eligible too. e.g. A well-explained question, active participation in a discussion, a helpful 
      answer, etc.<br />
      Remember to mention your username.</li>
      <li>Contributor: Has contributed to an open-source project. [Bug reports : +1pt, Code :+2pts] 
      <br />
      Evidence: Links to commits/issue tracker that include your contribution</li>
      <li>Reader: Has read an SE book (programming language books don't count) and can explain 
      some interesting points about it. [+1pt per book, up to 3pts].<br />
      Evidence: A short (~200 words) paragraph about what you learned from the book.</li>
      <li>Writer: Has a web site or a blog [+1pt] that is related to SE in particular or Technology 
      in general. Blogs/sites created exclusively to fulfill requirements of other modules do not 
      count. Has written an article/blog to help others e.g. tutorial [+2pts].<br />
      For example, you can try <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pptlabs/">PowerPointLabs</a> or 
      <a href="https://github.com/hubturbo/hubturbo">HubTurbo</a> and write a short blog post.<br />
      Evidence: Link to website, post</li>
      <li>Hobbyist: Has done a coding pet project (not for a module or an employer) just for the fun 
      of it [private: +1pt, public: +2pts].<br />
      Evidence: Link to the project (put the project online if you haven't done it already)</li>
      <li>Competitor: Has taken part in coding competitions [participated: +1pt, won something: 
      +2pts].<br />
      Evidence: Any online page listing your name as a competitor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Work done before or during the semester are eligible for points. The protocol to claim XP 
    will be activated about halfway into the semester.</p>
    <p>You can earn XP for work done until end of week 7, including work done before the semester.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Earning points: </strong><span class="highlighted">Don't get stressed over participation 
  points</span>. If you are a 'good citizen' for a reasonable portion of the module 
  (e.g., attend most lectures/tutorials, submit most assignments on time, answer an occasional 
  question etc.), you will earn the full quota of participation marks automatically. <span class="highlighted">
  There is no need to put in extra effort to earn participation points</span>. You 
  will be able to earn the full 10 marks for participation, even if you miss a few lectures, 
  tutorials, and minor submission deadlines. For example, a student who participated well in 7 
  lectures + 7 tutorials, submitted 7 IVLE quizzes, submitted acceptable work for CE1, CE2, 
  V0.0, V0.1, V0.2, V0.4 but missed V0.3 can still earn 200 points.<br />
  Only those are habitually sloppy and disengaged will earn lower than the full marks.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Participation points help you keep track your progress, gives you an incentive to 
  do small things right, and help you detect when your participation level is falling behind. 
  However, note that the points awarding criteria for some tasks are quite subjective. While we 
  try to apply these criteria uniformly across the class, it is possible that some tutors are 
  stricter than others in awarding points. Therefore, <span class="highlighted">do not use 
  participation points to compare yourself against the whole class</span>. If you must compare, 
  compare your points against teams under your tutor only. On a related note, if your tutor 
  seems stricter than others, consider it a good thing because stricter grading helps you more 
  in identifying weak areas. However, if you think your participation level fell below 200 
  because your tutor is stricter than others, you can write to the lecturer to see if that is 
  really the case.</li>
  <li><strong>Checking the score</strong>: We shall start updating the 'leaderboard' page of our 
  website from week two. You can use it to check your current total any time after that.</li>
  <li><strong>If there is a discrepancy</strong> between the points you received and the points you think you 
  should receive: This can happen due to a minor mistake by a tutor or due to a misunderstanding 
  on your part.<span class="highlighted">Notify the tutor only if</span>  the total discrepancy 
  is significant (&gt;5). In other cases, we don't consider it worthy of the effort to 
  investigate the matter. The participation points scheme is not meant to be a precision 
  instrument. Its purpose is to give a rough idea of your participation level in various module 
  activities.</li>
