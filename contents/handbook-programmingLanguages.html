	Our learning materials (lecture slides, tutorials, etc.) use Java code examples. But <span class="highlighted">
	you may use Java or C++ in your tutorial/exam answers, and for the project.</span>
</p>
<p>
	The module doesn’t “teach” any of these two languages. We assume you already know these languages.
	We expect you to learn on your own any language constructs not covered in your previous modules.
</p>
<img src="../images/Java and Cpp inventors.png" style="width: 250px;">
<p>Handouts provide C++ translations for some Java examples. If you are a C++ user and if feel a certain
	Java example is not clear to you and there is no C++ translation provided for it, please let us know so that
	we can add the C++ translation for it.</p>

	I encountered a problem. How do I get help? Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using Eclipse) 
	or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the 
	teaching team is happy to work with you when you look for a solution/answer. But we do not do it for you. 
	Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor right away. Instead, this is what you should do. 
	We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’.
</p>

<p>
	However, we don’t want you to suffer without any help if you cannot solve a problem on your own. We have weekly wrap up 
	session (Wed-Fri) on <a href="http://teammatesOnline.info">TEAMMATES</a> which you can use to let us know the doubts and 
	difficulties you are facing. We’ll do our best to direct you toward solutions. Please use those sessions 
	<span class="highlighted">only if you facing difficulties 
	even after attending the corresponding tutorial session</span>.
