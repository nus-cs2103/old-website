<p>"You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)" is a model 
for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile 
problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
<p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated. 
That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to 
refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning experience will be richer if we 
let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our 
instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to 
draw; that is a decision you have to make yourself.</p>
