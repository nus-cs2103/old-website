<div id = 'v01Manual'>
<p>
	Your project manual should contain following sections:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Cover page</strong>: As before. Use the same template. Change '[V0.0]' to '[V0.1]' in the page
		header.
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Credits</strong>: Acknowledgements of any third party materials used (if any). You may also
		list any extra (i.e. not required by the module) tool/technique you used (we want to know who went beyond
		the given set of tools/techniques). Omit this section if you did not use any third party materials.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> User guide</strong>: As before. You may modify this section if you’ve changed the features since
		the last submission. It is ok if some of the features mentioned here are not implemented yet.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Developer guide</strong>: The intended audience for this document is an incoming developer (i.e. a new project
		member) that will depend on this document to tell how the product has been designed and implemented.That
		is, it will be used for onboarding new developers. The document contains just enough information required
		for that person to get into the project. The basic questions you should ask yourself when writing this
		document are:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What do we know about the system at this point?
		</li>
		<li>
			Which part of that knowledge will be useful for a new project member?
		</li>
		<li>
			What is the best way to pass that knowledge to the new member? Note that some information can be passed on in
			the form of code without any additional documentation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Given below are some things you could consider including. Note that you are not required to include them
		all. Neither you are restricted to what is listed below.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Architecture
		</li>
		<li>
			important APIs of each component
		</li>
		<li>
			Design descriptions (can include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, notable algorithms ...)
		</li>
		<li>
			Code examples (only if necessary to explain an intricate implementation detail)
		</li>
		<li>
			Instructions for setting up and testing
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Suggested max length for this section: 10 pages excluding cover page and appendices.
	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>submission</strong>: <span class="highlighted">Submit a single pdf file</span> that 
	contain all sections described above. File
	name is as before, but change ‘V0.0’ to ‘V0.1’. Submit to the appropriate IVLE folder. 
	You may use GitHub to
	create an online user guide and a developer guide (see the <a href="https://github.com/collate/collate">
	collate project</a> for an example), but you should
	still submit the project manual as a pdf file.

	<strong>evaluation</strong>: 15++ points.
