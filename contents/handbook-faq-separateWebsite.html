<p>We have a separate website because some  the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.</p>
<p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant 
information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always 
expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <span class="highlighted">will remain 
online</span> at<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/">
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>
