<p>'Suggested length' aims to encourage you to write shorter documents containing just 
the right amount of content. We do not read beyond this suggested length unless what we have read 
up to that point makes us want to read more. Â Therefore, it is in your interest to stick to the 
suggested length. But if you think you have more good stuff than that would fit in the page limit, 
go ahead and include them by all means.<br />
Note that you can also include information as appendices. They are not counted towards the page 
limit.</p>
