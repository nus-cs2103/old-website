<p>We do take team size into account when grading.</p>
<p>3 member teams are allowed to do slightly less than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% less) and 5 
member teams are expected to slightly more than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% more). The variation 
of expected output is less than 25% (although the variation in team size is 25%). This is to 
account for the fact that extra people adds to the communication overhead.</p>
