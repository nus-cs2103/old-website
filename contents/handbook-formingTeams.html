<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Team size</strong>: The default <span class="highlighted">team size is four</span>. 
		Please do not form teams with five or more.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Roles and responsibilities:</strong> You need to elect one of your team members as 
		the <span class="highlighted">team leader</span>. All members
		should be <span class="highlighted">put in charge of various aspects</span> of the project, 
		as explained above in this document under ‘V0.0
		project manual’ section.
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Team composition</strong>: We allow some freedom in choosing team members, 
		subject to these
		constraints:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Teams of <span class="highlighted">single nationality are not allowed</span> 
			(rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams).
			However, we allow same nationality teams if the only language common among all team members is English.
			e.g. an all-Singaporean team that include both Chinese and Malay students.
		</li>
		<li>
			No more than one exchange students per team (rationale: to increase interaction between exchange
			students and NUS students).
		</li>
		<li>
			All team members should be in the same tutorial. <span class="highlighted">Delay forming teams
			 until your place in a tutorial is
			confirmed.</span> We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Also note that we may modify teams when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object.
		Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong> Team ID</strong>: This will be given to you after forming teams (week 2-3). It has 
			the form
			{tutorial id}-{team number}{c|j} where c,j indicates your language (C++, Java). e.g, w14-2j means you
			are in tutorial w14 (i.e., Wed 1400-1500), team 2, using Java.
		</li>
