<p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be 
offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. 
This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students forget this harsh reality when 
they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work ethics. 
That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission 
instructions, arriving on time etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of 
the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>
