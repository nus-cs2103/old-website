<p><span class="highlighted">I will respond to you within 24 hours</span> if it was an email sent 
to me or a forum post directed at me. If you don't get a response within that time, <span 
class="highlighted">please feel free to remind me</span>. It is likely that I did not notice your 
post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
<p>Similarly I expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally 
(not mass email) promptly.</p>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of 
	  professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you 
	  met me along the corridor, said 'Hi Damith, good morning' and I walked away without saying 
	  anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds 
	  to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type "Noted. Thanks
	  " and hit 'send'.</p>
      <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for 
	  something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to me requesting a reference letter and 
	  I did not respond at all because I didn't want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated 
	  because you wouldn't know whether to look for another professor or wait longer for my 
	  response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying 
	  nothing is not acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether 
	  you received the email.</p></td>
