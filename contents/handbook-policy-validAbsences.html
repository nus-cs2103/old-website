<p>There is no need to inform us. If you miss a lecture/tutorial for a valid reason, just do your 
best to catch up. We'll be happy to help if required. As for participation points, you have 
plenty of other opportunities to earn the points you missed. <br />
If you fail to earn the required percentage of participation points at the end of the semester due 
to a valid reason, just let us know so that we can give you an alternative means to earn the 
shortfall. Only then do you need to submit an MC or an excuse letter. <br />
But note that <span class="highlighted">an MC or an excuse letter cannot be used to earn 
participation points</span> for the same reason an MC on the exam day cannot earn you a '
passing grade'. They can only be used to avoid penalty or get an alternative opportunity to 
earn credits.<br />
To clarify, here is our policy: "CS2103/T lectures and tutorials provide opportunities to 
earn participation points. In the event of a student failing to earn the required total of 
participation points for the semester, additional opportunities can be provided in lieu of the 
ones lost due to LOA/MC"</p>
<p>However, we are willing to give special consideration to cases where you tend to lose more than 
5 points from an absence due to a valid reason, on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in such 
cases to make alternative arrangements no later than two weeks from your return from LOA/MC.</p>
