<p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation
  /availability among team members,</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, <span class="highlighted">do not expect everyone to have the same 
  skill/motivation level as you</span>. It is fine if someone wants to do less
    and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is
    a bad person. Everyone is entitled to have their own priorities.
  </li>
  <li>Second, <span class="highlighted">don't give up</span>. It is unfortunate
    that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good
    learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team
    every day :-)
  </li>
  <li>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need
    to take initiative to turn the situation around or else the whole team is
    going to suffer. Don't hesitate to <span class="highlighted">take charge
  </span> if the situation calls for it. By doing so, you'll be doing a favor
    for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members,
    but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't
    worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until you try.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, don't feed angry or 'wronged'. Teamwork problems are not uncommon
    in this module and we know how to grade so that you will not be penalized
    for others' low contribution. We can use Git to find exactly what others did.
    It's not your responsibility to get others to contribute.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt if the project work is not going smooth
  due to team issues. Note that the below measures can result in some team members doing more
  work than others and earning better project grades than others. It is still better than sinking
  the whole team together.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the
    team should take over the critical parts of the code.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an
    integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to
    maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept
    any code that breaks the existing product or is not up to the acceptable
    quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the
    integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably,
    you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such
    'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality
    of the code. Also refer the workflow described in the 'A safer
    workflow using forks and pull requests' section of the Handbook:
    Appendix E (Using GitHub Project Hosting)
  </li>
</ul>

<strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members </strong>:
<ul>
  <li>Re-distribute project work so that such team members cannot bring down the entire team.
  </li>
  <li>However, do not leave out such team members from project communications.
    Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute more any time they wish to.
  </li>
  <li>Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during peer evaluations so that they do get the grade
    their work deserves, no more, no less.
    </li>
  <li>Be courteous to such team members too. Some folks have genuine problems that prevent them from contributing more
    although they may not be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume
    everyone else is doing their best too, although their best may be lower than yours.
  </li>
</ul>
