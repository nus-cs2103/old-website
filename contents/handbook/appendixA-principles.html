<p><strong>[ You . Together . Continuously . Reach ]</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The product is you, NOT what you build.</p>
<p>The software product you build is a side effect only. You are the product of this module.
  This means,</p>
<ul>
  <li>We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. We take the
    route that allows you to learn the most.
  </li>
  <li>Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority
    (although we try to do a bit of that too). Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy
    of, high quality software engineering work is our priority.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Following from that, we evaluate you on not just how much you've done, but also, how well
  you've done those things.</p>
<p>Here are some of the aspects in which we try to make you more professional:</p>

<p><strong>We learn together, NOT compete against each other.</strong></p>
<p>You are not in a competition. Our grading is not forced on a bell curve.</p>
<p>Learn from each other. That is why we publish submissions.</p>
<p>Teach each other, even those in other teams. Those who do it well can become tutors next time.</p>

<p><strong>Continuously engage, NOT last minute heroics.</strong></p>
<p>We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does
  not require 'last minute heroics'.</p>
<p>In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute
  mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.</p>

<p><strong>Where you reach at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</strong></p>
<p>When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you.
  Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what
  you knew to begin with. The full 10% allocated to intermediate deliverables is within the reach
  of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.</p>
