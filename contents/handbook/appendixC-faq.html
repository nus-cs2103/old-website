<h3>Why the workload is so high?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-highWorkload">
  <p><img src="../images/Why workload heavy.png" width="378" height="340"/></p>
  <p>CS2103/T prepares you for many higher-level project modules (CS3216/7, CS3201/2, CS3281/2/3/4,
    CG3002, etc.), each requiring a slightly different skill set. It is also the only SE course some
    of you do before going for industry internships. Therefore, we have to cover many essential SE
    concepts/skills and also provide enough exercises for you to practice those skills. This is also
    why we don't have time to go very deep into any of the topics.</p>
  <p>Remember, everything you learn here is going to be useful in a SE-related career.</p>
  <p>Also, consider this a gradual introduction to 'heavy' modules; most project modules
    you do after this are going to be much heavier :-p<br/>
  <p><span class="highlighted">How to reduce the workload?</span> There are many activities worth
    only bonus points and there are other optional activities that you can omit to reduce workload.
    Those activities are useful only if you are aiming for a high-end SE career, CS2103 tutorships,
    recommendation letters from the module lecturer, to enroll in selective modules (e.g. CS3216/7),
    etc.</p>

<h3>Why so much bean counting?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-beanCounting">
  <p><img src="../images/small things matter.png" width="600" height="300"/></p>
  <p>Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be
    offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications.
    This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students forget this harsh reality when
    they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits.
    That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission
    instructions, arriving on time etc.).</p>
  <p>But unlike the real world, we are forgiving. That is why you can still earn full 10 marks of
    the participation marks even if you miss a few things here and there.</p>

<h3>Why you force me to visit a separate website instead of using IVLE?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-separateWebsite">
  <p><img src="../images/Forces me to visit a separate website.png" width="655" height="271"/></p>
  <p>We have a separate website because some of the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by
    IVLE.</p>
  <p>On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant
    information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always
    expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <span class="highlighted">will remain
    online</span> at<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/">
    http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S2/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>

<h3>Why slides are not detailed enough, handouts are wordy?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-slideFormat">
  <p><img src="../images/slides not detailed enough.png" width="733" height="221"/></p>
  <p>Slides are not meant to be documents to print and study for exams. Their purpose is to support
    the lecture delivery and keep you engaged during the lecture. That's why our slides are less
    detailed and more visual.</p>
  <p>Handouts are wordy because they are reference materials for you to study at your own pace and
    use during the module and later. The format is similar to materials (books, online articles, etc.)
    you will have to refer to when you work in the industry. They too are not meant to be cheat
    sheets 'to study for exams with minimal effort'.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why so much self-study?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-selfStudy">
  <p><img src="../images/so much self study.png" width="763" height="307"/></p>
  <p>Self-study is a critical survival skill in SE industry. Lectures will show you the way, but
    absorbing content is to be done at your own pace, by yourself. In this module, we still tell you
    what content to study and also pass most of the content to you. After you graduate, you have to
    decide what to study and find your own content too.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why do I have to come to tutorials on time?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-timelyArrival">
  <p>Unlike most modules, our tutorials are group work. Arriving on time minimizes the time wasted by
    others waiting for you to arrive or briefing you on what you missed. Being punctual is expected
    from a professional.</p>
</div>

<h3>What if I don't carry around a laptop?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-noLaptop">
  <p>If you do not have a laptop or prefer not to bring the laptop, it is up to you to show your
    work to the tutor in some way (e.g. by connecting to your home PC remotely), *without* requiring
    extra time/effort from the tutor or team members.</p>
  <p>Reason: You enjoy the benefits of not bring the laptop; you should bear the cost too</p>
</div>

<h3>Why very narrow project scope?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-narrowScope">
  <p>Defining your own unique project is more fun.</p>
  <p>But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The
    collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) build up about SE issues related to
    the project become shallow and stretched too thinly. It also affects fairness of grading.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296"/></p>
  <p>That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses
    on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project modules you
    can focus more on the creative side of software projects without being dragged down by
    nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like
    to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight
    variations of a given theme.</p>
  <p>Also note: The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for
    creativity. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you
    are, the more you need creativity to stand out.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why project requirements are so vague?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-vagueRequirements">
  <p><img src="../images/vague requirement.png" width="737" height="210"/></p>
  <p>"You tell me exactly what to do - I do that - you pay me (in grades)" is a model
    for contract work, not for learning. Being able to survive in imprecise, uncertain, volatile
    problem contexts is precisely what we are trying to teach you.</p>
  <p>For example, the best way to communicate something often depends on what is being communicated.
    That is why we don't specify the precise content for project documents. Instead, we aim to
    refine project documents iteratively. We believe the learning experience will be richer if we
    let you decide the best way to present your project information rather than just following our
    instructions blindly. For example, in real-life projects you are rarely told which diagrams to
    draw; that is a decision you have to make yourself.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why I'm not allowed to use my favorite OS/IDE/etc?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-favoriteTool">
  <p><img src="../images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287"/></p>
  <p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability,
    typicalness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting
    your choices:</p>
  <p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge, most
      specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering
      our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you
      to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one
      tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.
    </li>
    <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn
      to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred
      tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own
      toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers,
      such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google
      uses SVN as their revision control software. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool
      licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in
      their code base).<br/>
      While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport.
      As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over
      the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the
      best of a given environment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Practical reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means
      tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.
    </li>
    <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Getting started with Eclipse'.
      Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.
    </li>
    <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more,
      increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>

<h3>Why so many submissions?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-manySubmissions">
  <p><img src="../images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359"/></p>
  <p>The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the
    semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning
    effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application of theory' (i.e.,
    project work) evenly across the semester.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why not enough marks for intermediate submissions?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-intermediateMarks">
  <p><img src="../images/no marks for intermediate submissions.png" width="688" height="102"/>
  </p>
  <p>Intermediate submissions are also incremental submissions. Intermediate submissions are
    included in the final submission too and will earn marks at that point. They are there to help you
    do well in the final submission and for us to monitor your progress and guide you accordingly.
    They are a means to an end. They are not achievements themselves. By right, they shouldn't
    be given marks at all. :-)</p>
</div>

<h3>Why submission requirements differ between CS2103T and CS2101?</h3>
<div id="handbook-faq-cs2101Differences">
  <p><img src="../images/Submission requirements differ.png" width="300"/></p>
  <p>They do, and they should.</p>
  <p>CS2103T communication requirements are limited to a very narrow scope (i.e., communicate about
    the product to users and developers). CS2101 aims to teach you technical communication in a much
    wider context. While you may be able to reuse some of the stuff across the two modules,
    submissions are not intended to be exactly the same.</p>
