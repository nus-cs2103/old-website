<p>
  We use the <a href="http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/" target="_blank"> TEAMMATES</a> online peer evaluation system
  to conduct several rounds of peer-evaluations. <br>
  All peer evaluations will be taken into account when determining your participation marks.
  The system also allows you to give anonymous feedback to your teammates.

  <strong>Extra Requirements: </strong> [considered for participation marks]

      Submitting peer evaluations is compulsory. <span class="highlighted">If you routinely miss submitting peer

            <strong>Choosing a profile photo</strong>:<br>
             The purpose of the profile photo is for the teaching team to identify you. Therefore, you should choose
            a recent individual photo showing your face clearly. Some examples can be seen in the
            'Teaching team' page. Given below are some examples of good and bad profile photos.<br>

<div id="giving-peer-feedback">
  Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning
  outcome of this module. <span class="highlighted">Those who give ineffective feedback will be penalized.</span> 
  <p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend.
      Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.
    </li>
    <li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback
      (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>)
      to the same team member is not being honest.
    </li>
    <li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that
      the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she
      did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative
      feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  The final peer evaluation will be used to determine the level of contribution from each member to the
  project. In that peer-evaluation you will be asked to <span class="highlighted">estimate the contribution
  of each team member</span> (including yourself) to the project so far.
</p>
<img src="../images/peer evaluations.png" width="70%">
<p>
  <span class="highlighted">Final peer evaluation affects your grade</span> in the following way:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If there is a general consensus about how much each one contributed, we award grades based on the
    contribution levels submitted through the peer evaluation. i.e., if everyone agrees you did more than
    others, you get more marks.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are significant discrepancies in the peer evaluations (e.g., you say you did an [equal share + 20%]
    while
    your team says you did an [equal share - 10%]), we will investigate further before finalizing project marks. For
    such teams, we are likely to request some or all members to <span class="highlighted">
    submit an additional individual report</span> to itemize and quantify the contribution to the project.
    <span class="highlighted"> Overclaimers will be penalized.</span> Please do not claim high just to ‘see how’.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Peer evaluations are <span class="highlighted">not visible to undergraduate tutors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="highlighted">If you disagree with the team’s opinion</span>, i.e., you think the perceived contribution
  is significantly different from what you actually contributed, you can help us grade you fairly by submitting an
  individual report (‘individual report’ is explained under V0.5 deliverables).
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are based on team member perceptions and may not reflect
  your real contribution. <span class="highlighted">We use those numbers primarily to identify cases that need further investigation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  You may <span class="highlighted">ignore minor variations</span> in the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES.
  For example, the difference between [Equal share] and [Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due
  to rounding off within the system.
</p>
<p>
  Also keep in mind that it is human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from others when
  one’s own contribution is being compared to that of others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived
  contribution’ to be somewhat lower than what you actually did.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unhappy about the peer-feedback received and would like to make your views known to the team,
  please allow at least one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond more
  rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle
  such a situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting views, opposition, and even
  deliberate sabotage.

      <p> A final note on this issue : </p>
      <span class="highlighted">Please be sincere about how much you can do from the beginning</span>, rather than
      let your team members figure it out over the long run. Tell them how much you can do and what kind of work you are
      willing to do. If you are not open about it, they will still figure it out at the end; they will still report it
      (via the peer-evaluations), and your score will be adjusted all the same. Being open about it on the other hand
      can save everyone a lot of frustrations, unpleasantness, and bitterness. </p></td>
