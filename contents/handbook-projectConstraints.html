	You should also comply with the following constraints. The purpose of these constraints is to increase
	comparability among submissions and to maximize applicability of module content in the project.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-Desktop</strong>: The software should work on a desktop without network/Internet
		connection. It should not be a mobile app or a cloud-based application.
	</li>
	Reason: Desktop apps are more general than other platforms such as mobile/embedded/web and therefore,
	provides a good starting point before you move to those platforms.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. If you implement
		a GUI, it should be primarily for output. That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to
		collect input. Some minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input
		should be command-driven. Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over
		key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key
		combinations.
	</li>
	Reason: GUIs are quite tightly coupled with the platform. e.g., a Web GUI is quite different from an Android
	GUI which may be quite different from an iOS GUI and so on.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-Standalone</strong>: The software should work stand-alone. It should not be a
		plug-in to another software. However, you can build optional extensions that integrate your application
		with other existing software. Furthermore, you are allowed to build extensions that can plug into your
		software.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-No-Database</strong>: The software should not use relational databases. Data
		storage must be done using text files you create yourself.
	</li>
	Reason: Using relational databases reduces the scope for applying Object-oriented techniques.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored locally and should be in a
		human editable text file. The intention of this constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the
		task list by editing the data file.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-OO</strong>: A significant part of the software should follow the Object-oriented
		paradigm. However, some parts of the application can be non-OO if it can be justified.
	</li>
	Reason: For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-Windows</strong>: The software should work on the Windows 7 or Windows Vista OS. It
		should work on both 32bit and 64bit PCs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer.
		Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical
		functionality.
	</li>
	Reason: We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong> Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is
		allowed but only if they,
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			are free.
		</li>
		<li>
			do not require any installation by the user of your software.
		</li>
		<li>
			do not violate other constraints.
		</li>
	</ul>
	and subject to prior approval by us. We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the
	learning objectives of the module.
	<br>
	Please post your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.
	<br>
	Reason: The whole class should know which external software are used by others so that they can do the same if
	they wish to.
	<br>
