        <strong>More about in-lecture quizzes</strong><br>
        We use the QuestionSMS system for in-lecture quizzes. Questions will be shown during the lecture. 
        You can answer using SMS or the web interface <a href="http://qsms.nus.edu.sg/post.aspx">http://qsms.nus.edu.sg/post.aspx</a>.

            <strong>What if (I forgot to bring my phone | my phone battery died | I don't have a phone)?</strong><br>
            Well, you don't get participation points if you didn't send the answers. Missing a few participation 
            points due to these reasons should not affect your final grade if you score enough points from other activities.

            <strong>What if I sent the SMS answer but I did not get participation points?</strong><br>
            Please inform our tutor in charge during the following lecture. Remember to bring your phone to show the sent message.

            <strong>How does the system know which number belongs to which student?</strong><br>
            It picks up the HP number from myISIS. Please update your HP number using myISIS.

    <strong>Webcast</strong>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. 
    Please treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Handouts</strong>: Each lecture consists of 1-3 sections, supported by separate handouts. 
	
	The full handbook containing all the sections is uploaded to IVLE workbin at the beginning of the semester. 
    
	You are welcome to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="highlighted">Read before tutorials</span>: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder 
    how to apply those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial. If you have any followup 
    questions about handouts, please ask during tutorials (if there is spare time) or post in IVLE forums.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Post-lecture quizzes</strong>: 
    Each lecture will be followed by an IVLE quiz that can earn you participation points.
    <br>
        Purpose: for you to self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings (if any).
    <br>
        You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count the best effort only. 
        Points will be added to the leaderboard in the following week.
    <br>
        IVLE quizzes open on Friday right after the lecture and closes on the following Tuesday 2359.
</p>

    <strong>Slides</strong>: Since we are giving separate handouts, lecture slides do not contain content that you can print 
    and use as a reference for exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam reference while slides will play only 
    a supporting role during lecture delivery. <span class="highlighted">Slides will be uploaded</span> <em>after</em> the lecture.
