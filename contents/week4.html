            <h3>[Fri 23:59] CE1: Code Review</h3>
            <div>
                [individual, 5x2 pts]
                <br>
                <br>
                In this exercise, you will <span class="highlighted">review the code of two other classmates.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Rationale:</b> Code reviews are an important part of a software engineer’s life. While some of you may not be experienced enough to be a good code reviewer, 
                doing a code review is still a valuable opportunity to experience code from the reader’s point of view. It will also help you to improve the quality of your own code.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Procedure:</b> 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Check the review assignment (i.e. who will review whose code) 
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxGIuUgcm1U5mmzeX3saYvdO83VvXj3X-UQLrlD0Vw0/edit#gid=0">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Download the pdf files submitted by the two assigned reviewees, from the IVLE workbin. Note that some may not have followed the submission instructions closely and named their files in different ways. 
                        Do a Ctrl+F in the workbin page to find the files submitted by the reviewee. Some may even have put the pdf file inside the zip file. Yes, it is quite annoying when people do not follow the instructions :-p
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refresh your memory about the coding standard you were expected to follow. Links to the standard are given in the Tutorial 2 description above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Review the code for the following aspects.  Note that we are reviewing the coding style only, not the accuracy or the performance.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Formatting:
                        <br>
                        a) Code formatted with syntax coloring to help the reader.
                        <br>
                        {opposite: Code just dumped into a document without much regard to the readability. Some statements overflow to the next line}
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Names - meaning:
                        <br>
                        b) Class/method/variable names are meaningful and intuitive.
                        <br>
                        c) Boolean variables or methods returning boolean values are named to indicate their boolean nature e.g. isValidName hasExtraSpaces()
                        <br>
                        d) Variable names are based on nouns (e.g. maxValue) and method names are based on verbs (e.g. getValue)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Names - case:
                        <br>
                        e) Class/method/variable/constant names use upper/lower/Camel/Pascal case appropriately
                        e.g class name: CityConnect (Pascal case), method name : getValue (Camel case), constant name MAX_VALUE (upper case with underscores)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Comments:
                        <br>
                        f) Comments are used to explain WHAT and WHY aspects of the code, not HOW aspects.
                        <br>
                        g) No trivial comments.
                        <br>
                        h) Minimal but sufficient level of commenting.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Magic numbers
                        <br>
                        i) No magic numbers/strings.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Layout:
                        <br>
                        j) Code neatly laid out to improve readability.
                        <br>
                        k) Braces placement, indentation, and alignment follow the standard.
                        <br>
                        l) Braces are used even for blocks with just one statement.
                        <br>
                        e.g.
                        if(isValid){<br>
                                processInput(input);<br>
                        }
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        SLAP:
                        <br>
                        m) Short methods with not too-deep nesting.
                        <br>
                        n) Each method written generally at a similar level of abstraction.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Testing:
                        <br>
                        o) A reasonable set of test cases to cover various usage scenarios.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submit your findings using the TEAMMATES session ‘CE1 code review’ (open from Week 4 Mon, 7pm). Aspect above for which the code needs improvement, give examples when you submit the review.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        e.g.
                        <br>
                        a) The variable name t2 is not very meaningful
                        <br>
                        k) Braces in the getLines() method do not follow the standard.
                        <br>
                        m) Not enough SLAP in the main method. It can be shorter and the nesting can be reduced.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A code review requires both technical skills and people skills. <span class="highlighted">Be honest</span> in the review. Your review will not affect the reviewee’s CE1 grade.
                        <br>
                        <span class="highlighted">Be kind</span> too. There is no need to criticise harshly. No need to be witty. Just offer gentle suggestions on how to improve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it seems the reviewee’s has not submitted CE1, review the code from another classmate (of your own choosing).

            <h3>Create spike solutions (optional)</h3>
            <div>
                If you would like to get a head start on coding your project, you can do coding experiments around this time to figure out how to implement certain functionalities that you might need later in the project. 
                Such solutions are called <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.htmlA">spike solutions</a>.
                Here are some examples for which you can create spike solutions.
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Find a library that can parse strings that represent dates. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find a way to change color in text output.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a simple GUI that has a text box for input and a textarea for output. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Explore suitable data formats (e.g json, icalendar, xml, etc.) for saving data for your project. Find libraries for easy writing/reading of data in the selected formats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Find how to use threads to perform tasks in the background e.g. check for expiry of a deadline periodically.

            <h3> [Team, 1pts] Do a preliminary schedule</h3>
            <div>
                Decide at which milestone you will deliver each user story. Assign user stories to the appropriate milestone in GitHub.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It may feel premature to create a schedule at this point because you have not even designed a product yet. Do it anyway. 
                        It will give you a better sense of how much you can do during the semester. You can change the schedule later as necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When deciding under which milestone a user story should go, consider importance of user stories, dependencies among them, the time between milestones, and module requirements for different milestones (refer handbook).

            <h3> [If you have time] Conceptualize the product</h3>
            <div>
               Conceptualize the product based on the use stories you have selected. You might need to create some UI prototypes at this point. After that, you can start writing the project manual V0.0.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Before writing the user guide, you should have a very clear and detailed understanding about how your final product will look like and behave (external behavior, not internal implementation). 
                        This understanding can change over the course of the project. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of the final goal at all times. It is not enough to have a ‘rough idea’ of the end product.

                       Give this problem a try (at least some thoughts) before coming to the lecture. We are going to do it as an exercise during the lecture (30 minutes).
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Imagine you are building an online system called <b>TeamFormer</b>. TeamFormer is a system for helping CS2103 students during team forming period. It lets students record who is in which team. 
                       Students can use the system to find teams short of members and students looking for teams, easing the team forming process. 
                       Note that the system is not meant as a platform for students to communicate with each other to find team members. 
                       Students are supposed to talk to each other and form teams outside the system, as they do now. 
                       TeamFormer simply helps students to see the team forming status of the class (e.g., who has teams and who don’t) and record their own team after forming a team. 
                       It is also meant to ease the team-forming-related workload of instructors.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       What should be the following elements of TeamFormer requirements?
                       <ul>
                            <li>
                                Vision: {A short statement describing the product’s objective/direction}
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                User types/roles: Students, Instructors, {any other user types?}
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                High-level workflow: {In the process of team forming, who will do what first, and what will happen next, and so on? Where does TeamFormer fits into this workflow?}
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Scope: {What will TeamFormer do, and more importantly, what team-forming-related things it will NOT do?}
                            </li>
                       </ul>
                       Specify important requirements of TeamFormer as a list of User Stories.
                       <br>
                       Write one use case (i.e., textual form) for one of the user stories that you think will result in the most complex user interaction.
                       <br>

                                    Overview: Testing should be done earlier and at lower levels without relying entirely on system testing or higher-level component testing. 
                                    API testing can be automated using testing frameworks such as JUnit, and with the help of drivers and stubs. 
                                    TDD is a unique approach to ensure the testability of the component from the beginning and not as an afterthought.
