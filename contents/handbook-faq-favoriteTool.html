<p>We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, 
typicalness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting 
your choices:</p>
<p>Pedagogical reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We use 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools: Most bleeding edge, most 
  specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering 
  our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We expect you 
  to eventually (after this module) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one 
  tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.</li>
  <li>Learn to thrive under given conditions: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn 
  to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred 
  tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own 
  toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, 
  such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google 
  uses SVN as their revision control software. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool 
  licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in 
  their code base). <br />
  While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. 
  As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over 
  the psychological hurdle of individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given 
  environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the learning activities are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means 
  tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.</li>
  <li>We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Getting started with Eclipse'. 
  Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.</li>
  <li>When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, 
  increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.</p>
