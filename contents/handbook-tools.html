  <strong>Communication</strong>:
</p>
<p>
  Keeping a record of communications among your team can help you, and us, in many ways. We encourage you to do
  at least some of the project communication in written medium (e.g., GitHub Issue Tracker)
  to practice how to communicate technical things in written form.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Collaboration platform</strong>: We are going to <span class="highlighted">use GitHub as the hosting and collaboration platform</span>
  of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.). See <a href="#handbook-appendixE-github"> Appendix
  E</a> for more info on how to setup and use GitHub for your project. </p>
<p>
  <strong>IDE</strong>: We <span class="highlighted">require you to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a></span>
  (latest stable release) for module related programming work.
  Because all team members will work on the same code base and project tutors too have to go through the code for
  testing
  and evaluation, it is troublesome to use multiple IDEs. Furthermore, when everyone uses the same tool, it creates a
  bigger collective know-how about the tool which makes troubleshooting easier and the productivity higher.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Revision control</strong>: </p> <p> You are required to use Git. Other revision control software are not
  allowed. <br>
  The recommended GUI client for Git is <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> (which comes bundled
  with Git), but you may use any other, or none.
