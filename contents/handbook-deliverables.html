<p>
	Here is the outline of the project structure and the deliverables at various milestones of your project.
	The sub-sections further down explain each deliverable in detail.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> CE1</strong>: First, a coding exercise to freshen up your coding skills and prepare you for the
		project. Some of the code you write for coding exercises may be useful for the project later. This is an
		individual exercise. You can start this before you team up.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> V0.0</strong>: Next, you will specify what you propose to build, in the form of a user guide.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> CE2</strong>: In the meantime, you will also do another coding exercise to affirm the skills you
		honed during CE1.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> V0.1</strong>: Iteration 1 comes next, in which you implement a working version (named V0.1) of
		the product that contain a selected subset of features. Deliverables at the end of this iteration are
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Product V0.1 (live demo)
		</li>
		<li>
			Project manual V0.1 (more sections added to V0.0)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong> V0.2-V0.4</strong>: Next come three rapid iterations: V0.2, V0.3, V0.4. In each iteration, you
		will improve the functionality delivered in the previous iteration, add some more functionality, and
		refine the document to match the product. You will do a live demo of each of these versions
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong> Reason</strong>: The idea here is that you should work on the project at multiple times, instead
			of as one burst. This simulates an industry environment where developers have to edit code written a
			significant time ago. This will help you appreciate the importance of code quality and test automation.
		</li>
		We name releases V0.1, V0.2 etc instead of V1.0, V2.0 etc to emphasize that we are still in early stages of the
		project.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong> V0.5</strong>: The final iteration produces V0.5, a polished version of V0.4. This is a very
		short iteration, used mostly as a buffer. It is too risky to add new functionality in this iteration.
		Deliverables are,
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Product V0.5
		</li>
		<li>
			Project manual V0.5
		</li>
		<li>
			Product demo (live)
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
