  Here is the outline of the project structure and the deliverables at various milestones of your project.
  The sub-sections further down explain each deliverable in detail.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> V0.0</strong>: First, you will specify what you propose to build, in the form of a user guide.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> V0.1</strong>: Iteration 1 comes next, in which you will refactor the starter code to create a very basic
    version of your target product. the product that contain a selected subset of features.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> V0.2-V0.4</strong>: Next come three rapid iterations: V0.2, V0.3, V0.4. In each iteration, you will improve
    the functionality delivered in the previous iteration, add some more functionality, and refine the user guide and
    the developer guide to match the product. You will do a live demo of each of these versions.<br>
    <strong> Reason</strong>: The idea here is that you should work on the project at multiple times, instead
    of as one burst. This simulates an industry environment where developers have to edit code written a
    significant time ago. This will help you appreciate the importance of code quality and test automation.
    We name releases V0.1, V0.2 etc instead of V1.0, V2.0 etc to emphasize that we are still in early stages of the
    project.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> V0.5</strong>: The final iteration produces V0.5, a polished version of V0.4. This is a very
    short iteration, used mostly as a buffer. It is too risky to add new functionality in this iteration.
    Deliverables are,
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Product V0.5
