<p>
	For milestones V0.2-V0.4, you are encouraged to update your project manual regularly to match the
	product. However, you are not required to submit them for evaluation, unless your tutor specifically
	requests you to. Note that this flexibility is just to reduce your workload. In a production environment,
	the documentation should always be kept in sync with the product.
