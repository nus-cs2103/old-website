<h3>Policy on following instructions</h3>
<div id="policy-followingInstructions">
  <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important 
    that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates 
    unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative signals about your work attitude. That is 
    why we give participation points for following instructions carefully.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on grading smaller/larger teams</h3>
<div id="policy-teamSize">
  <p>We do take team size into account when grading.</p>
  <p>3 member teams are allowed to do slightly less than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% less) and 5 
    member teams are expected to slightly more than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% more). The variation 
    of expected output is less than 25% (although the variation in team size is 25%). This is to 
    account for the fact that extra people adds to the communication overhead.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on project work distribution</h3>
<div id="policy-workDistribution">
  <p>It is OK to do less or more than equal share in your project team. However, be prepared to receive a 
  different grade than your team members if you didn't do an equal share.</p>
  <p>Everyone is expected to do a significant coding and some testing. If you limit yourself to 
  tasks like documentation only, you are likely to fail the project component.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on absence due to valid reasons (e.g. MC, LOA, University events)</h3>
<div id="policy-validAbsences">
  <p>There is no need to inform us. If you miss a lecture/tutorial for a valid reason, just do your 
  best to catch up. We'll be happy to help if required. As for participation points, you have 
  plenty of other opportunities to earn the points you missed. <br />
  If you fail to earn the required percentage of participation points at the end of the semester due 
  to a valid reason, just let us know so that we can give you an alternative means to earn the 
  shortfall. Only then do you need to submit an MC or an excuse letter. <br />
  But note that <span class="highlighted">an MC or an excuse letter cannot be used to earn 
  participation points</span> for the same reason an MC on the exam day cannot earn you a '
  passing grade'. They can only be used to avoid penalty or get an alternative opportunity to 
  earn credits.<br />
  To clarify, here is our policy: "CS2103/T lectures and tutorials provide opportunities to 
  earn participation points. In the event of a student failing to earn the required total of 
  participation points for the semester, additional opportunities can be provided in lieu of the 
  ones lost due to LOA/MC"</p>
  <p>However, we are willing to give special consideration to cases where you tend to lose more than 
  5 points from an absence due to a valid reason, on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in such 
  cases to make alternative arrangements no later than two weeks from your return from LOA/MC.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on email response time</h3>
<div id="policy-responseTime">
  <p><span class="highlighted">I will respond to you within 24 hours</span> if it was an email sent 
  to me or a forum post directed at me. If you don't get a response within that time, <span 
  class="highlighted">please feel free to remind me</span>. It is likely that I did not notice your 
  post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
  <p>Similarly I expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally 
    (not mass email) promptly.
  </p>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to personal emails</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
          <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of 
          professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you 
          met me along the corridor, said 'Hi Damith, good morning' and I walked away without saying 
          anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds 
          to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type "Noted. Thanks
          " and hit 'send'.</p>
          <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for 
            something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to me requesting a reference letter and 
            I did not respond at all because I didn't want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated 
            because you wouldn't know whether to look for another professor or wait longer for my 
            response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying 
            nothing is not acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether 
            you received the email.</p>

<h3>Policy on tech help</h3>
<div id="policy-techHelp">
  <p><span class="highlighted">Do not expect your project tutor to code or debug for you</span>. We 
  strongly discourage tutors from giving technical help directly to their own teams because,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>we want to train you in troubleshooting tech problems yourselves. Allowing direct tech help 
    from tutors transfers the troubleshooting responsibility to tutors.</li>
    <li>it may not be fair for some teams because some Java teams might be supervised by C++ tutors 
    and vice versa.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlighted">It is ok to ask for help from classmates even for assignments</span>, 
  even from other teams, as long as you don't copy from others and submit as your own. It doesn
  't matter who is helping you as long as you are learning from it.</p>
  <p><span class="highlighted">We encourage you to give tech help to each other</span>, but do it in 
  a way that the other person learns from it.</p>
  <p>Please refer Appendix D: How to get Help in CS2103/T.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on publishing submissions</h3>
<div id="policy-publishingSubmissions">
  <p>The source code and all other submitted documents may be made publicly available sometime after 
  the submission for reuse without any restrictions. <br />
  Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. We publish your submissions 
  only after giving you the credit you deserve for it. Besides, if you were the first to think of 
  something your peers are willing to adopt later, that means you are already ahead of them and they 
  are unlikely to earn more marks by adopting your ideas.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on plagiarism</h3>
<div id="policy-plagiarism">
  <p>What's allowed:</p>
  <p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class, not just a selected 
  group. That is,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
    <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, note that most submissions will be published to the class after the submission 
  deadline, after which they <span class="highlighted">can be 'reused' by others</span> subject to 
  the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
  <p>If you submit code taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
  <p>Detection: </p>
  <p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or 
  renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions are published to the class and sooner or 
  later somebody notices the plagiarism.</p>
  <p>Penalties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For activities earning participation points: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we 
    do not take further action. Because participation points are given for effort and all students 
    can earn the required 80% easily, such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students. 
    Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better 
    rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing, 
    go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.</li>
    <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be 
    reported to the university for disciplinary action.</li>
  </ul> 
</div>

<h3>Policy on reuse</h3>
<div id="policy-reuse">
  <p>In general, <span class="highlighted">reuse is encouraged</span>. However, note that reuse has 
  its own costs (such as the learning curve, additional complexity, usage restrictions, and unknown 
  bugs). Furthermore, you will not be given credit for work done by others. Rather, you will be 
  given credit for using work done by others.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>The work has been published by us.</li>
        <li>You clearly give credit to the original author(s).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>You are allowed to reuse work from external sources, subject to following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source 
      project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.</li>
        <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources 
      clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' 
      menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble if you 
      unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
        <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please <span class="highlighted">
      do not use 3rd-party images/audio</span> in your software unless they have 
      been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found it in the Internet does 
      not mean it is free for reuse.</li>
        <li><span class="highlighted">Always get permission from us before you reuse</span> things 
      from elsewhere.Please post your 'request to use 3rd party library' in IVLE forum 
      for approval. That way, the whole class get to see what libraries are being used by others.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Policy on help from outsiders</h3>
<div id="policy-outsiderHelp">
  <p>In general, you are <span class="highlighted">not allowed to involve outsiders</span> in your 
  project except your team members and the teaching team. However, It is OK to give your product to 
  others for the purpose of getting voluntary user feedback. It is also OK to learn from others as 
  long as they don't do your project work themselves.</p> 
</div>

<h3>Policy on suggested length for submissions</h3>
<div id="policy-submissionLength">
  <p>'Suggested length' aims to encourage you to write shorter documents containing just 
  the right amount of content. We do not read beyond this suggested length unless what we have read 
  up to that point makes us want to read more.  Therefore, it is in your interest to stick to the 
  suggested length. But if you think you have more good stuff than that would fit in the page limit, 
  go ahead and include them by all means.<br />
  Note that you can also include information as appendices. They are not counted towards the page 
  limit.</p>
