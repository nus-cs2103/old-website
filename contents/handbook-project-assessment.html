    Note that project grading is <span class="highlighted">not competitive (not bell curved)</span>. <span
        class="highlighted">CS2103T projects will be assessed separately from CS2103 projects. </span> This is to
    account for the perceived difference in workload.
    Given below is the marking scheme.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Total</strong>: 50 marks (25 individual marks + 25 team marks)
</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><strong>Product features </strong> [team][10 marks] - How good is your software as a product?
        <p>
            Based on the features implemented, how well they fit together to make a good product, and how well they are
            demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘Half-baked’ (i.e. not production quality) or 'ill-fitting' (feature does not go well with the other
            features) features will not earn marks at all and could even be penalized. It may be better to remove such
            features before submission. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Design </strong>[team][5 marks] - How good is your internal design?
        <p>
            Evaluated <span class="highlighted">solely based on what we can learn from the developer guide.</span>
            Evaluated by lecturer.
        </p>
        Criteria considered:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Conformance with the multi-level top-down approach (i.e. design at high-level first, and do the
                lower-level design of each component later)
            </li>
            <li>
                Conformance with the OO paradigm
            </li>

                Application of patterns and principles
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Implementation</strong> [individual][15 marks] - How good is your implementation?
        A measure of the quality and the quantity of code you have written yourself. On average, a student is expected
        to
        write 0.5-1.5 KLoC.
        Evaluated based on an inspection of the collated code (submitted in your *.md files) by at least two tutors.
        <br>
        Criteria considered:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Following SLAP (IMPORTANT).
            </li>
            <li>
                Following the coding standard given (IMPORTANT).
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Using at least some unit tests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Commenting at the right level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Exception handling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Neatness and human readability.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Expectations:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each person is expected to implment one or more features.
                Each person is expected to write backend code, frontend code, test code, user documentation, and
                developer
                documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>QA</strong> [team][10 marks] - How good is your Quality Assurance?
        Evaluated based on our own testing. A well written user guide and a product that conforms to the user guide
        (i.e. no
        bugs) will give you a high mark.
        <p>
            Things that may be considered: number of bugs, level of test automation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <p>
        Expectations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is no requirement for a minimum covereage level. Note that in a production environment you are often
            required to have at least 90% of the code covered by tests. In this project, it can be less.
        </li>
        <li>
            How much of each type of testing should you do? We expect you to decide. You learned different types of
            testing and what they try to achieve. Based on that, you should decide how much of each type is required.
            Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the
            effort required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Applying TDD is optional. If you plan to test something, it is better to apply TDD because TDD ensures that
            you write functional code in a testable way. If you do it the normal way, you often find that it is hard to
            test
            the functional code because the code has low testability.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <li>
        <strong>Documentation</strong> [individual][5 marks] - How well does your user guide and developer guide achieve
        their objectives? Evaluated based on the parts you have written for the user guide and developer guide.
        Evaluated by
        lecturer and TA. <br>
        Criteria considered:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Explanation should be clear and written to match the audience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design explained in top-down, multi-level fashion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good use of visuals to complement text.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <STRONG>Project management</STRONG> [team: 5 marks][individual: 5 marks] - How well you worked together as a
        team to follow a systematic process?<br>
        For the team component, we look for,
        <ul>
            <li>
                Good version control, based on the repo.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good task definition, assignment and tracking, based on the issue tracker.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good use of buffers (opposite: everything at the last minute)
            </li>
            <li>
                Iterative (opposite: fake iterative, doing most of the work in one iteration). <br>
                Passed almost all checkpoints from V0.0 to V0.5
            </li>
        </ul>
        The individual component is determined by peer evaluation from your project team members.
    </li>

</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Penalty for late submission:</strong> <span class="highlighted">-1 mark for each hour delayed.</span>
    Even a 1-second delay is penalized, irrespective of the reason. Based on the time shown by IVLE.
