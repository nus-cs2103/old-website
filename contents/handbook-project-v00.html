    The objective of this deliverable is for you to analyze requirements, conceptualize the product, and document it.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong> Step 1</strong>: Brainstorm user stories. These represent requirements.
        <ul>
            <li>
                e.g.<br>
                <code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that
                    need to be
                    done ‘some day’.</code>
                <br>
                <code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code>
                <br>
                <code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to
                    track.</code>
                <br>
                <code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to
                    use various
                    commands.</code>
                <br>
                <code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code>
                <br>
                Note how the story covers who (the user), what (the functionality) and why (the value) aspects.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is ok to have more user stories than you can deliver in the project.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> Step 2</strong>: Survey existing products. See how well existing products meet Jim's needs.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Select a few competing products to study. e.g. Google Calendar Quick Add feature, Todo.txt, Fantastical
                etc. Each person should study at least one existing product. Identify strengths and weaknesses of the
                product w.r.t. how well it can cater for Jim’s requirements. .
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Note</strong>: Don’t get discouraged if an existing product meets Jim’s needs quite well. We
                are
                trying to learn SE, not sell a product.
            </li>
            <li>
                After looking at existing products, you may want to go back and revise some of the user stories.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> Step 3</strong>: Conceptualize the product as a user guide:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Divide user stories into two categories:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>likely</strong>: You hope to implement these features by V0.5.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>unlikely</strong>: Nice-to-have features that you may implement if you have time.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Based on the likely user stories, specify the product you are going to build, in the form of a user
                guide. Yes,
                strangely enough, in this project we draft the user guide before we build the product. This will help
                you/us
                visualize the final product before you start implementing it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember to include the exact command format because it is the core part of your UI.
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    Use the documentation in the sample project as an example. Given below are sections to include.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>About Us page</strong>:
        <p>This page is used for module admin purposes.
          <span class="highlighted">Please follow the format closely to avoid penalties</span>.
          For example, use suitable photos (similar to those in the 'Teaching Team' page).</p>
        <p>
            Indicate the different roles played and responsibilities held by each team member. You can
            reassign these roles and responsibilities later in the project, if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Roles imply aspects you are in charge of and responsible for. E.g., if you are in charge of
                documentation,
                you are the person who should allocate who should write which part, ensure the document is in right
                format,
                ensure consistency etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some typical roles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Team lead </strong>: Responsible for overall project coordination.

                    documents.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>

                    related to
                    the specific tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may define additional roles.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please make sure each of the above roles are assigned to one person in the team. It is OK to have a
                ‘backup’ for
                each role, but you should still have one person who is unequivocally the main person playing that role.

    <li>
        <strong> User guide</strong>:<br>
        Describe what the product would be like when it is submitted at the end of the semester. Starting from the
        time user starts using the product for the first time, describe how the user uses the product to accomplish
        various tasks.
        <br>
        Here are some ‘quick start guides’ you can look at for inspiration when writing your user guide:
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/collate/collate/blob/master/docs/User-Guide.md" target="_blank"> Collate project</a>,
        <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT202033" target="_blank">iPhone :How to get started</a>,
        <a href="https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/instructorHelp.jsp#gs" target="_blank">TEAMMATES (for instructors)</a>
        <br>
        Use UI prototypes/sketches if necessary. They can be simple sketches drawn on whiteboard/paper and
        scanned/photographed or created using a tool such as PowerPoint, HTML, or
        <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balasmiq</a>. <br>
        State what you honestly believe you can do, based on information you have at this point. You will not be
        penalized if you cannot deliver what you proposed to deliver. It is OK to tweak the project scope along the
        way.
        <br>
        <span class="highlighted">Specify the command format in detail</span> as it is an important part of the product
        functionality.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User Stories</strong>: Give a list of the user stories, including priorities.
        This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> User cases</strong>:
        Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>:<br>
        Note: User stories capture functional requirements. What are the non-functional
        requirements of your project? Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more.
        e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Glossary</strong>: Define terms that are worth defining.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Product survey</strong>: Describe a summary of the product survey.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>suggested length</strong>: Take the sample project as a baseline.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>submission</strong>: Update your project repo and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging" target="_blank">git
    tag</a> as <code>V0.0</code>. Refer to the Schedule page for further submission instructions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Grading</strong>: Counted under 'Project management' component of the final project grade.
