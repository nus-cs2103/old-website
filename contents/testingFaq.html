<h3><a name="test-void"></a>How to test void methods?</h3>
<div>Use other means to check the effect of the method. E.g., if you are testing a 
<code>deleteFile(fileName)</code> method, you could do something like this.
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">deleteFile(fileName);
assertFalse(isFileExists(fileName));
</code></pre>
</div>

<br>
<div>In addition, you can refactor to make methods return values. For example, consider the following 
method.
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">void display() {
    // for each line in file
         // display line
}</code></pre>
It can be refactored like this:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">void display(){
    String content = getFileContent(fileName);
    print(content);
}</code></pre>
Now, you can unit test <code>getFileContent(fileName)</code> method. There is no need to unit 
test <code>display()</code> method because most of it’s logic is in <code>getFileContent(fileName)</code> 
that is already unit tested.
</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="is-it-enough"></a>Is it enough to check for the correctness of status message only?</h3>
<div>Some of your methods returns the status of the method execution as a string. Just checking the return 
message of such methods is not enough if the command is expected to change the state of the data. You 
can use techniques used for testing void methods (given above) to check the correct execution of the 
method, in addition to checking the status message.</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="test-private"></a>How to test private methods?</h3>
<div>For now, make them public. In Java, there is 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34571/how-to-test-a-class-that-has-private-methods-fields-or-inner-classes" target="_blank">
a way to access private methods using reflection</a>. Alternatively, we can omit testing private methods because only public 
methods are exposed to others. If public methods are working correctly, private methods must be working correctly too.<br>
A more extensive discussion of this issue can be found <a href="http://www.artima.com/suiterunner/private.html" target="_blank">here.</a></div>

<br>
<h3><a name="test-reading-user"></a>How to test the reading of user commands?</h3>
<div>That part is hard to test. Separate the ‘reading user command’ part from the rest and test the rest. 
See <code>CityConnectTest.java</code>(in the Schedule page) for an example.</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="test-text-display"></a>How to test displaying of text to the user?</h3>
<div>Similar to the previous question. Separate the generating of the text to display from displaying the 
text. The former is the more complicated part which should be unit tested.
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">String result = executeCommand(command); //unit test this method
displayToUser(result); //simple, no need to unit test</code></pre>
If your software is completely text based, you can use the I/O redirection method covered in lecture 1 
to test the software including the input and output.
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-java">TextBuddy.exe < input.txt > output.txt
FC output.txt expected.txt</code></pre></div>
</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="method-test-another"></a>Can we use one method in our code to test another method?</h3>
<div>Yes, it is acceptable. You can use methods that are already unit-tested to test other methods. 
e.g., you can use <code>clear()</code> and <code>add()</code> methods when testing the <code>sort()</code> 
method.</div><br>
<div>Note: This is not strictly ‘unit testing’ as we are not testing the unit in complete isolation from 
the rest of the code, but it is acceptable because other units are already tested and are under your 
control too.</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="why-write-test"></a>Why write tests? Manual testing is much easier.</h3>
<div>Automated tests are not just to check if the code works NOW, but they help to ensure it keeps working 
FOREVER. Their main purpose is regression testing.</div>

<br>
<h3><a name="why-TDD"></a>Why TDD?</h3>
<div>Writing tests first makes you write more testable code. If you write the functional code first, you often 
find such code is harder to test. Furthermore, it encourages you to think WHAT the code should do before you 
figure out HOW the code should do it.</div>
