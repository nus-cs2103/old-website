        Propose an architecture for your product. 
        i.e. Divide the product into a small number of components. 
        Discover some of its component APIs. 
        Where applicable, draw some sequence diagrams (at least one) to support the discovery of APIs.
        Keep the hard/soft copies of your diagrams to bring to the tutorial (rough hand-drawn sketches are OK too).
        If you are not very sure about how to draw sequence diagrams, you can do the following optional 
        team exercise to increase your confidence before attempting the above task.

            For the chosen architecture, draw relevant sequence diagrams and discover some API definitions.

            Important: <span class="highlighted">This is not a low-level detailed design.
