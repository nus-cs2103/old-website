        Start using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo">HubTurbo</a> to access GitHub when it helps. 
        Make a note of which features of HubTurbo is done well and which are not done well. 
        These observations can help you in designing your own product. 
        Keep in mind the intended audience of HubTurbo is different from your own project, so be careful when adapting ideas from HubTurbo to your project.
        Feel free to report bugs and suggest improvements in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HubTurbo/HubTurbo/issues">HubTurbo issue tracker</a>.

      <div>
        Propose an architecture for your product. 
        i.e. Divide the product into a small number of components. 
        Discover some of its component APIs. 
        Where applicable, draw some sequence diagrams (at least one) to support the discovery of APIs.
        Keep the hard/soft copies of your diagrams to bring to the tutorial (rough hand-drawn sketches are OK too).
        If you are not very sure about how to draw sequence diagrams, you can do the following optional 
        team exercise to increase your confidence before attempting the above task.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Draw your individual architectures (that you came up with previously) on the whiteboard.

            Compare and contrast with team members.

            Decide an architecture for the project.
            This can be one of the architectures proposed by a team member, or a new one created by combining those proposals.
            You are required to use the whiteboard for this exercise.

          </li>
          <li>
            For the chosen architecture, draw relevant sequence diagrams and discover some API definitions. 
            For example, there should be an SD to illustrate how the architecture supports the use case of adding a task. <br>
            Important: <span class="highlighted-darktext">This is not a low-level detailed design. 
            The design should be kept at high-level (i.e architecture level).

                  Overview: During the detailed design, which can be complex,
                  it is good to follow a common design paradigm. OO is the paradigm followed most widely in the industry.
                  When using OO, we view a system as interacting objects. Objects represent entities in the real world and
                  encapsulate data and operations related to those entities.
