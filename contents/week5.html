         i.e. Divide the product into a small number of components.
         Discover some of its component APIs.
         Where applicable, draw some sequence diagrams (at least one) to support the discovery of APIs.
         Keep the hard/soft copies of your diagrams to bring to the tutorial (rough hand-drawn sketches are OK too).
