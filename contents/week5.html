            Draw your individual architectures (that you came up with previously) on the whiteboard.

            Decide an architecture for the project.
            This can be one of the architectures proposed by a team member, or a new one created by combining those proposals.
            You are required to use the whiteboard for this exercise. 
            To increase peer learning, <span class="highlighted-darktext">leave your diagrams on the whiteboard for the next team to see</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the chosen architecture, draw relevant sequence diagrams and discover some API definitions. 
            For example, there should be an SD to illustrate how the architecture supports the use case of adding a task. <br>
            Important: <span class="highlighted-darktext">This is not a low-level detailed design.

            <strong>Overview:</strong> It is important to consider the proposed product
            from the users' point of view and provide good solutions to users' problems
            rather than slap together a slew of features that you as developers find
            interesting. UI prototypes are especially useful in visualizing the product
            early and improving the user experience.
