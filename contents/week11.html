      <div>
        Similar to V0.3, but follow V0.4 requirements instead.
        In particular,
        <ul>
          <li>Remember to collate code/tests/docs written by you
            (see <a href="handbook.html#handbook-project-v04" target="_blank">V0.4 Requirements</a> for more info).<br>
          Your tutor will do a brief review of the collated code to give you some feedback about your code quality.</li>
          <li>Dogfood your product and find ways to improve it. Remember to keep the dogfooding version of the
          app (i.e. the jar file) in a separate folder as evidence of dogfooding.
          i.e. Don't use the IDE for dogfooding
            (Dogfooding is an acceptance test; it should be done in the user environment)</li>
          <li>Note that there are <span class="highlighted">special requirements for the V0.4 demo</span>
            which require advance preparations. More details in the 'V0.4 Requirements' link above.</li>
