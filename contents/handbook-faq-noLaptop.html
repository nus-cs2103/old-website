<div id = 'faq-noLaptop'>
<p>If you do not have a laptop or prefer not to bring the laptop, it is up to you to show your 
work to the tutor in some way (e.g. by connecting to your home PC remotely), *without* requiring 
extra time/effort from the tutor or team members.</p>
<p>Reason: You enjoy the benefits of not bring the laptop; you should bear the cost too</p>
