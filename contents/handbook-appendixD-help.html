<p>In this module, we want to move you away from 'hand holding'. We want you to learn how to solve
  problems on your own. This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it
  needs practice.

      Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using Eclipse) or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the
      difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the teaching team is happy to work with you when
      you look for a solution/answer. But we do not do it for you. Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor
      right away. We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe
      in ‘tough love’.
      <p>
        However, we don’t want you to suffer without any help if you cannot solve a problem on your own. We have weekly
        wrap up session (Wed-Fri) on <a href="http://teammatesOnline.info" target="_blank">TEAMMATES</a> which you can use to let us
        know the doubts and difficulties you are facing. We’ll do our best to direct you toward solutions. Please use
        those sessions <span class="highlighted">only if you facing difficulties even after attending the corresponding
        tutorial session</span>.

The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors
are not around to help me?' </p>
<p><img src="../images/the good reasons to get home early.png" width="300"/></p>
<p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications
  on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between aaa and bbb?</p>
<p>What not to do: Email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless
  it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know.</p>
<p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, here are the things you should do:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Check what is given</strong>: Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures,
    handouts, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write
    an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that shouldn't be your default behavior. We know that
    sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in handouts/handbook etc. But you
    should try first.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong>: It is very likely the answer already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every
    programming-related question has been answered in places like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>.
    Don't give an opportunity for someone to tell you, 'Have you heard of a thing called Google?'.<br/>
    Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to
    fix the problem. Even if not, a <span class="highlighted">web search on the error message</span> 
    is a good starting point.  <br>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Ask peers</strong>: <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask your team members. <br/>
    <br/>
    Ask classmates using the IVLE forum. Asking questions in IVLE is encouraged. Even if you figured
    out one way to solve a problem, discussing it on IVLE might lead you to
    better ways of solving it, and will help other classmates who are facing similar problems too.
    If you are really shy to ask questions in IVLE, you may use 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> 
    to submit your question anonymously which we will then post in the forum.

            Use Rubber Duck Debugging:<br>
            <p>Rubber duck debugging is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of
              debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a
              programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it,
              line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

  <li>
    <strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow. <br/>
    <br/>
    Here are some tips for posting help request:
    <ul>
      <li>PLEASE search for existing answers before you post your question in those public forums; You
        don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research'
        person in a public forum.
      </li>
      <li>Learn to isolate the problem. "My code doesn't work" isn't going to help even if you post
        the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part
        that doesn't work and strip it down to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error.
        Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least
        it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.
      </li>
      <div class="additional-info"><p>Tip: How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time)
        that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem
        with the least amount of code remaining.</p>
      </div>
      <li> Generalize the problem. "How to write tasks to a text file using Java" is too specific
        to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post
        a thread called (or search for) "How to write to a file using Java".
      </li>
      <li> Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is
        relevant to your problem, you chances of getting an answer in the first try
        is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can help you, it will take
        longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.

  </li>
  <li><strong>Talk to the lecturer</strong> before or after the lecture. The lecturer will be at the lecture venue from
    30 minutes
    before the start of the lecture.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Request our help</strong>: Failing all above, request for help using weekly 'doubts and help requests'
    sessions hosted on TEAMMATES (session open Wed-Fri weekly)
