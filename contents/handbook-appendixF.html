<p>If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation
/availability among team members,</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, <span class="highlighted">do not expect everyone to have the same 
  skill/motivation level as you</span>. It is fine if someone wants to or less 
  and have low expectations from the module. That doesn't mean that person is 
  a bad person. Everyone is entitled to have their own priorities.</li>
  <li>Second, <span class="highlighted">don't give up</span>. It is unfortunate 
  that your team ended up in this situation, but you can turn it into a good 
  learning opportunity. You don't get an opportunity to save a sinking team 
  every day :-)</li>
  <li>Third, if you care about your grade and willing to work for it, you need 
  to take initiative to turn the situation around or else the whole team is 
  going to suffer. Don't hesitate to <span class="highlighted">take charge
  </span> if the situation calls for it. By doing so, you'll be doing a favor 
  for your team. Be professional, kind, and courteous to the team members, 
  but also be firm and assertive. It is your grade that is at stake. Don't 
  worry about making a bad situation worse. You won't know until you try.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have very unreliable or totally disengaged team members
</strong>: Re-distribute project work so that such team members cannot bring 
down the entire team. However, do not leave out such team members from project 
communications. Always keep them in the loop so that they can contribute more 
any time they wish to. Furthermore, evaluate them sincerely and fairly during 
peer evaluations so that they do get the grade their work deserves, no more, 
no less. Be cordial to such team members too. Some folks have genuine 
problems that prevent them from contributing more although they may not 
be able tell you the reasons. Just do your best for the project and assume 
everyone else is doing their best too, although their best may be lower than 
yours.</p>
<p>Given below are some suggestions you can adopt. Note that the below measures 
can result in some team members doing more work than others and earning better 
project grades than others. It is still better than sinking the whole team 
together.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Redistribute the work</strong>: Stronger programmers in the 
  team should take over the critical parts of the code.</li>
  <li><strong>Enforce stricter integration workflow</strong>: Appoint an 
  integrator (typically, the strongest programmer). His/her job is to 
  maintain the integrated version of the code. He/she should not accept 
  any code that breaks the existing product or is not up to the acceptable 
  quality standard. It is up to others to submit acceptable code to the 
  integrator. Note that if the integrator rejected your code unreasonably, 
  you can still earn marks for that code. You are allowed to submit such 
  'rejected' code for grading. They can earn marks based on the quality 
  of the code. Also refer the workflow described in the 'A safer 
  workflow using forks and pull requests' section of the Handbook: 
  Appendix E (Using GitHub Project Hosting)</li>
